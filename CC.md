## The 6 building blocks of cases

mastering each building block is important.
Whenever get a task or question from interview, they are somehow related to one of these building blocks. Each can be solved by a step by step method here.

These can be learnt in isolation.
### Structuring-related Building Blocks

#### Brainstorming
Use issue tree to build a structured list of hypotheses and ideas, not throwing out random list of ideas or hypotheses without structure or priority.

Ex: Iron mining company seen revenue drop 30% last year despite heavy investments, what could explain that?

#### Frameworks
Frameworks are decision making plans - a list of questions you need to answered to make a decision and a systematic way of making sense of them. 
#### Hypothesis testing
Serveres to test the hypotheses you organized and prioritized when brainstorming. These tests need to be rigorous but also practical.

### Analysis-related Building blocks
#### Estimations
Market sizing etc...
What is market size of road maintenance in the US?
#### Quantitative Analyses
Getting the right number is the minimum - how you do this and what you do after you find it is as important. Also sometimes interviewer might hide data from you and you need to ask for it.
#### Chart Interpretation
See charts from already done analysis. Great candidates find more insights, communicate them better and develop better next steps.

### How to tie together

This is a simplified path.

Often obvious which building block the interviewers question is in, so very easy for you.

### Mindset

- Keep notes 

- You can get right answer but get rejected. You need to build a strong argument, not find one answer.
- Preparation is a case itself
	- Not use only easy cases to prepare, do the hard ones
- Be curious and ask why
	- interviewer loves curious candidates
	- Feeling by minute 5 of case should be i know i will get to answer, not hopefully figure out.
	- Thinking should be made before presenting framework not after
		- ask yourself why this segment why that, osv...
		- keep curiosity up and think about problem with why
- Be curious about feedback
	- dont take it at face value
	- why and how




## Estimations

Goal of estimation case is not to just pass it, but to show that you think as the consultant does.
- Also not unnormal for consultants to discuss an industry with someone much more experienced than them in it
- Therefore they need to understand it better

### Estimations (market sizing): The 5 step approach

1. Clarify scope
	1. Make sure you knwo what to estimate
2. Structure problem
	1. No numbers yet just say what you will do
3. Choose assumptions
	1. assign values to variables
4. Calculate
	1. get to answer
5. Check answer
	1. does it make sense? Compare to something else


#### Example

My approach:
1. US population
2. Segment by age
3. Percentage of those who chew bubble gum
4. How often does each segment chew bubble gum
5. add it all together


Interviewer:

Clarify scope: FÖRSTÅ ALLTID NÅGOT OM MARKNADEN
- Only bubble gum like candy or also nicotine gum and such?

Interviewers approach:

Does this make sense?
- If market is 9,2B and us population is 320 M, then each american spend approximately 30 dollars per year on bubble gum, which is between 1-3 meals a year
- Makes sense


### In depth

#### Clarify scope

- What unit does Is market size nr of customer of nr of dollars? What unit
