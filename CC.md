Pointers:
- When building brainstorming 
	- Be structured and use Algebraic, process, conceptual (3C, 4P), segment and opposite words
	- First layer should allow for solution and give good insights


## The 6 building blocks of cases

mastering each building block is important.
Whenever get a task or question from interview, they are somehow related to one of these building blocks. Each can be solved by a step by step method here.

These can be learnt in isolation.
### Structuring-related Building Blocks

#### Brainstorming
Use issue tree to build a structured list of hypotheses and ideas, not throwing out random list of ideas or hypotheses without structure or priority.

Ex: Iron mining company seen revenue drop 30% last year despite heavy investments, what could explain that?

#### Frameworks
Frameworks are decision making plans - a list of questions you need to answered to make a decision and a systematic way of making sense of them. 
#### Hypothesis testing
Serveres to test the hypotheses you organized and prioritized when brainstorming. These tests need to be rigorous but also practical.

### Analysis-related Building blocks
#### Estimations
Market sizing etc...
What is market size of road maintenance in the US?
#### Quantitative Analyses
Getting the right number is the minimum - how you do this and what you do after you find it is as important. Also sometimes interviewer might hide data from you and you need to ask for it.
#### Chart Interpretation
See charts from already done analysis. Great candidates find more insights, communicate them better and develop better next steps.

### How to tie together

This is a simplified path.

Often obvious which building block the interviewers question is in, so very easy for you.

### Mindset

- Keep notes 

- You can get right answer but get rejected. You need to build a strong argument, not find one answer.
- Preparation is a case itself
	- Not use only easy cases to prepare, do the hard ones
- Be curious and ask why
	- interviewer loves curious candidates
	- Feeling by minute 5 of case should be i know i will get to answer, not hopefully figure out.
	- Thinking should be made before presenting framework not after
		- ask yourself why this segment why that, osv...
		- keep curiosity up and think about problem with why
- Be curious about feedback
	- dont take it at face value
	- why and how




## Estimations

Goal of estimation case is not to just pass it, but to show that you think as the consultant does.
- Also not unnormal for consultants to discuss an industry with someone much more experienced than them in it
- Therefore they need to understand it better

### Estimations (market sizing): The 5 step approach

1. Clarify scope
	1. Make sure you knwo what to estimate
2. Structure problem
	1. No numbers yet just say what you will do
3. Choose assumptions
	1. assign values to variables
4. Calculate
	1. get to answer
5. Check answer
	1. does it make sense? Compare to something else


#### Example
![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 09.27.02.png]]

My approach:
1. US population
2. Segment by age
3. Percentage of those who chew bubble gum
4. How often does each segment chew bubble gum
5. add it all together


Interviewer:

Clarify scope: FÖRSTÅ ALLTID NÅGOT OM MARKNADEN
- Only bubble gum like candy or also nicotine gum and such?

Interviewers approach:

![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 09.35.32.png]]


Does this make sense?
- If market is 9,2B and us population is 320 M, then each american spend approximately 30 dollars per year on bubble gum, which is between 1-3 meals a year
- Makes sense


### In depth

#### Clarify scope

- What unit does interviewer want you to estimate in?
	- Is market size nr of customer of nr of dollars?
	- If ask too late then interviewer will see you as consultant which wastes time by not asking right questions
- Beware of grey areas in the scope
	- ex Bubble gum only or also other utility gum in this question
	- Other example is TV market size
		- Common to look at how many TVs exist, replacement rate and get TV market size
		- But if you dont ask then you dont know if maybe TVs sold to businesses too or something like that too and not only consumers.
			- This is a important characteristic of a consultant

#### Structure problem

- Have interviewer understand full logic of what you are going to do before start estimating.
	- They can evaluate you properly on whatever they want to and you are on same team here, you need to try to help them and they will help you

- Use top down structures to make sure you are not leaving anything out and that the interviewer understands your ideas easily
- Explicitly state the algebra in your structure

#### Choose assumptions
- Based on logic and data
	- ex bubble gum want to know average yearly consumption per consumer
		- I chew 5 pieces a day, high frequency chew maybe 15 a day and low frequency 1-2 a day, and low frequency much more normal
	- This is IMPORTANT as it shows that you can build a quantitative model easily and even if the numbers are not that important it shows that you can understand stuff from data. 
- Focus on what matters
	- Show consultant that you focus on things that matter actually
	- If something is not that important, do not put too much time on it
		- ex penetration rate of bubble gum: Just come up with an answer and give rationalle behind it
			- if its something that is not intuitive, then you should just come up with something
- Get creative
	- as long as you use data and logic and structure
	- not hard and actually a bit fun
- Its OK to ask
	- ex if you do not know population of a specific country or such
	- if they say no then use a country of similar size or such

#### Calculate
- precise and efficient
	- dont make mistakes, but if make them need to catch them
	- take shortcuts
- Always reality check before start calculating

#### Check answer
This makes you standout from 95% of candidatees
- most people dont even know to do this

- Compare your value to something to get an idea of whether it makes sense or not
	- ex potential market for high protein potato chips
		- Lets say we come up with 5B
		- Then we can compare it to maybe whey market
		- OR
		- Lets say 5B means each American spend 1500 dollars a year on high protein chips, that makes no sense
- If have to change variables, go for variables that can change more!
	- Those also have the chance of being wrong more
	- in our ex: Bubble game penetration
- When interviewer asks you to check answer
	- dont check math only
	- use creativity and reality check your answer



### Drill 1 - nr of beds in brazil in dolalrs



![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 10.12.05.png]]




Need to explain growth and replacement rate if use


![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 10.22.30.png]]


![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 10.23.18.png]]

Mistakes include not doing comparisons:
- ex reality check with different stuff
	- How much of the market divided by population is the average persons spending on this?
		- Does that make sense?
	- What is minimum wage in brazil? Does it make sense to that

Drivers for sales of many things are the replacement rates and growth rates
- ==ALWAYS COMPARE IN THE REALITY CHECK==




## Brainstorming

ALWAYS STRUCTURED IN CONSULTING.

Always 3-4 brainstorming questions in cases, and important to be creative but having structure is much more important.
- So if ideas or hypothesis they want you to present, must be structured.

Its the first bulding block of the 6, and first of the structure ones
### The 3 step approach
See it as "Hypothesis generation question"

Its impossible to get offer from top consulting firm is because they cant structure their brainstorming well

==Generating a list of hypotheses (or ideas) needs to be==
- **structured**
- **prioritized**
- **With good hypotheses / ideas**

Ex: Iron ore mining company has seen revenues drop 30% in last year despite heavy investments, what are plausible hypotheses that could explain that?
##### Example - good and bad answers
**==Bad answer:==**
Maybe
- demand has dropped
- there is a recesion going on
- steel mills arnt buying much because they accumulated inventory
- sales force is not doing a good job
- prices have dropped

This answer does have good ideas, but they dont contain the hypothesis that could be confirmed. If you answer brainstorming like this, you wont get offer.

==**Good answer:**==
Could be Volume or Avg Price dropping.
If volume, could be 3 things
- not producing enough
- market buying less so demand is down*
- market share is down and buying from competitors

if avg price down could be 
- maybe average market price down**
- maybe product mix changed from high value to low value prudcts
- maybe company doesnt have market price

Because market is cyclicle, i believe that the reason could be because of the demand * and that market price is down ** and we are heading into a recession. Do we have data on this?


The approach to be better than other candidates who just come up with random lists. Our goal is a structured prioriteized list of good ideas and hypotheses.

1. **Define and structure**
	1. Define specifically
	2. Structure with MECE issue trees
	3. Make structure problem-specific.
		1. If you can, make the problem a metric. ex: If want help to make product better, what is better? 
		2. If cant reduce to metric (a number), what does better mean? Is it faster, stronger?
2. **Prioritize drivers**
	1. Take context and numbers in case into consideration
	2. Think which driver have highest impact
	3. Think which driver has higher likelihood / feasibility of working
3. **Generate hypotheses.** (Usually, candidates start here, which is a mistake) 
	1. State the obvious (because often clients ask about obvious things)
	2. Think outside the box
	3. Stay practical when you give an idea. Creative ideas are useless if they cant be implemented in reality.

**Example**:
MAD, a local Martial Arts Dojo has recently seen its revenue decline sharply. What could have happened?
- (Basically saying can you come up with a structured list of hypotheses?)

**1.DEFINE AND STRUCTURE**
1. Define 
	1. Revenue is from subscription and gear right?
	2. MECE tree
		1. Drop in # customers or drop in cash per customer
			1. # customers (Might have more churn than new customers)
				1. if customers down either customers leave more often or 
				2. we get less customers (cant make up for customers lost)
			2. drop in cash per customer
				1. drop in average monthly fees or
				2. drop in cash from gear sold per customer
2. MECE (basically own buckets osv) ^^
3. Usually you use price * quantity for revenue, but need to adjust it here so its problem specific. **MUST DO THIS EVERYTIME TO NOT BE REPETITIVE AND JUST SAY GENERIC FRAMEWORK and shows business sense** 
![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 20.05.50.png]]
**2.Prioritize driver** (**==ALWAYS ASK FOR DATA, IF NOT GIVEN DATA SAY THAT YOU WISH YOU WOULD HAVE DATA OTHERWISE THEY WILL THINK YOU ARE ASSUMING TOO MUCH==**)
1. Importnat because you can be 80/20
2. At 4 drivers at end of tree, which ones are more important?
3. Revenues have dropped really fast, so what could make it drop so fast?
	1. all 4 (3 tho) buckets are important but not the gear sale part
	2. Most likely that customer acquisition dropped really bad is jot the case (because even if we did bad job at marketing we would still have our customers)
	3. Also changing prices should not have such a drastic effect
	4. Hypothesis is that bunch of our drivers dropped out for some reason
4. So say to interviewer that if we dont have data, we should not be loosing that much revenue even if no new customers or gear sales.
5. If our customers are leaving more often, this could be due to
	1. Them leaving for our customers
	2. Them going to other exercise
	3. Or just stopped excersizing altogether

IMPORTANT:
- Give ratioanle why you are prioritizing specific bucket
- Dont say that cause is not in other buckets, but that you want to investigate this one first

![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 20.11.32.png]]

**3.Generate hypothesis**
Start by priority buckets, but then generate others for the other buckets as well.

Ex:
For competition bucket: 
- We might have new competitor which are clients are glocking to because of best trainer
- Maybe our business has changed and we fired a trainer which everyone loved or changed location
For physical exercise
- maybe was just a trend to do martials arts
- Something maybe happened and parents scared of martial arts

Stopped paying for exercise:
- economic crisis
- pandemic

Now go to other buckets based on priority.

#### How to finish question
How would you transform the hypothesis into solution?
Two ways:

1. Quantitive analysis + hypothesis testing 
	1. So lets say in the MMA example we went through all brainstorming.
	2. We would then say that we want to collect data to which revenue driver dropped, and that i want to see new customers, customer acquisitions, etc.
	3. When we know which is the reason ex if we are losing customers
		1. we would then go try and understand why they are going to others
		2. ex call them and ask or use surveys to see why
2. Interviewer tells you that you are right about hypothesis and now you need to find solution, so you need new brainstorming then.
	1. Lets say interviewer says that yes its fad market
		1. then we ask how many of current customers are going to leave too, and how will we keep them from leaving us
		2. Also how can we expand our business to fad business osv..

So we test the hypothesis before we even start brainstorming.


#### Frequently asked questions
1. when to use brainstorming?
	1. When interviewr asks for list (they dont want list they want structure)
	2. or when asked open "why do you think" or "what do you think" questions
2. how to handle what else questions?
	1. Interviewers press you. If they just want lots of volume, just give it to them
	2. Practice for "what else" questions by generating 30 ideas for every brainstorming you practice.
3. no time to think? No paper allowed? just say whats on my mind dont be structured? Should i still be structured?
	1. This is a trap, you will get declined if you answer unstructured
	2. ALWAYS be structured even if they tell you not to
	3. As you get better, learn how to brainstorm on the fly (especially for final round interviews)

When to not brainstorm:
- If interviewer answers your questions
- If you can get data if you ask for it (dont just assume stuff)
-  Dont give opinions, only hypothesis and data

###### Ex: Bike utilization rate
![[Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 10.29.45.png]]


If forget something, like here the redistribution bucket of putting back bikes at where they were, its no problem as you can just go back and mention it 

###### FRAMEWORK FOR PRODUCT BRAINSTORMING ^^
If its not being used - is it providing enough value (MECE down to actual value and perception of product)?
If it is providing value, how much hassle is it to use it?

### How to be MECE in brainstorming

Algebraic structures 
- simply break down into revenues and costs = profits

Process structures
- process with a beginning, middle and end
	- ex coffe capsule market sahre  can be seen as hourney customer goes through tochoose your capsules in the store.

Conceptual frameworks (qualitative frameworks)
- 3C's - Customer, Company and Competition
- 4P's - Product, Pricing, Placement and Promotion

Can also use little bit weaker:
Segmentations
- Basically use in collab with other three up there
	- Nespresso problem ex: might loose customers in business segments but not consumer


#### 5 ways to be MECE
##### Algebraic structures always work

![[Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 10.41.31.png]]
Notice how these structures are like an equation. “# of hires” * “Cost per hire” = “Hiring Costs”. “New hires to replace leaving employees” + “New hires to grow the company” = “# of hires”. Finally, the “Cost per hire” = “Cost to bring in a new candidate” + the “Cost to select new candidates”.

##### Process structures
Think of anything big businesses and governments repeatedly do as a process: **manufacturing**, **logistics**, **maintenance**, **sales**, **hiring**… The list goes on.

For example, imagine you need to find reasons why the manufacturing cost of a widget has increased. You can break this problem down to each manufacturing step, check if the cost has gone up in that step and if so, examine why. If manufacturing cost as a whole has gone up, at least one step’s cost must have gone up as well. Same if you need to find ways to increase sales efficiency: just break down the sales process into its steps and find ways to increase efficiency in each step. Or even eliminate a whole, useless step.
![[Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 10.45.39.png]]
Notice how breaking down the process forces you to think “outside of the box” and be thorough

##### Conceptual frameworks
3Cs
4Ps
McKinsey:
People, Process, Systems
- Any simple organizational problem can be pinned down into a problem with People, a problem with (or lack of) Processes or a problem with (or lack of) Systems

Conceptual framework:
Should BMW start uber thingy

![[Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 10.56.25.png]]

Using a poorly adapted framework will get your interviewer asking you questions. You better know how to answer them.

![[Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 10.57.24.png]]

Also, if your framework is ex conceptual and the interviewer is looking for something calculcation oriented, you can change it no worries.

If they build a conceptual structure, they can’t see how it would connect to an algebraic issue tree. If there’s an underlying process, they can’t see it unless they’ve chosen to use a Process structure. Having the mental flexibility to switch structures at will is critical when working with other people, both in case interviews and in real projects.

In the next two parts you’ll learn about Segmentations and Opposite words, two techniques to add flavor to your interview. They are great _complements_ to the three staples. Segmentations are like spices: they add nuance. Opposite words, in contrast, are like olive oil, they’ll make just about anything taste better (until you use too much of it).

##### Segmenting
Do this enough times and your interviewer will grow bored with the impression you’re guessing with no systematic approach. You’ll get mentally rejected soon enough.


##### Opposite words

![[Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 11.03.52.png]]

Say you have a 1-layer or 2-layer structure to answer a question. You can always add an extra layer with little effort by using opposite words. This extra layer is a nice-to-have, and it’s really nice to have it. You should use all resources at hand to improve the interviewer’s perception of how structured you are.

Opposite words are the last trick of the arsenal.

##### Bringing it all together (IMPORTANT)

To build the second layer, you pick each part of your 1-layer structure and break it down again. _You can do this using the same technique or a different one than the first level._ For example, if on the first layer you broke it down using an Algebraic structure, you can do the second layer using Conceptual structures. You can even use different techniques in different parts of the same layer. There are no hard rules as long as you keep each breakdown MECE.

![[Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 11.08.12.png]]

**Positives**:
The first positive is that the first breakdown uses the algebraic technique in an elegant way. This is highly useful because (i) it leads to some insight (that the market share problem could be caused by a problem in selling devices as well as capsules) and (ii) it is quantifiable. Because it is quantifiable, the interviewer _knows_ with just a little bit of data you could pinpoint the source of the problem and _ignore_ the other half of the problem

Another interesting (and positive) aspect of this structure is the double structure within machine share: I segment by market to quantify, but let the interviewer know I will use a conceptual (3Cs) structure to analyze _why_ there was a share drop in any segment that’s performing poorly. I’ve chosen the 3Cs because these segments have different demands and competition

A third cool feature of this structure is that it uses 4 of the 5 techniques. The core techniques tend to be to the left (on the upper layers, because they tend to be more insightful). But I also use “segmentations” and “opposite words” to make the issues more granular to the right side of the tree, where problems are more specific.


This is a bad breakdown even if it is MECE:
![[Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 11.10.04.png]]

First, the initial breakdown brings neither the ability to focus nor insight on the nature of the problem. On the last structure, the first breakdown was not only quantifiable (which helps you focus), but also insightful (it showed market share depended on share of machines AND share of capsules, two completely different things). This one is neither. Internal vs. External can be used to almost any problem, and thus it isn’t the best option to any.

The second issue with this structure are the random segmentations. Why dividing product attractiveness by business segment? Do customers change the type of product they prefer is they consume at home vs. in the office vs. in a restaurant? Perhaps, but not likely. Is there any evidence or logic behind segmenting a change in consumer’s preferences or behaviour by income level? I don’t know, it seems to me age or other factors could be equally important. The pattern you choose to segment your structure with should lead to an insightful hypothesis, otherwise it is just random (which will give you random chances of doing well in your cases).

The third issue with this structure is the reuse of the 4Ps – it is used to break down “Internal factors”, and a modified version is used to break down “Competitors have changed”. While this isn’t as critical as the last two reasons, it shows the candidate could’ve reorganized the structure better to avoid redundancy

These three shortcomings are aspects of underlying reasons that make the first structure good and the second structure poor, even if both are MECE...
