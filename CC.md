## The 6 building blocks of cases

mastering each building block is important.
Whenever get a task or question from interview, they are somehow related to one of these building blocks. Each can be solved by a step by step method here.

These can be learnt in isolation.
### Structuring-related Building Blocks

#### Brainstorming
Use issue tree to build a structured list of hypotheses and ideas, not throwing out random list of ideas or hypotheses without structure or priority.

Ex: Iron mining company seen revenue drop 30% last year despite heavy investments, what could explain that?

#### Frameworks
Frameworks are decision making plans - a list of questions you need to answered to make a decision and a systematic way of making sense of them. 
#### Hypothesis testing
Serveres to test the hypotheses you organized and prioritized when brainstorming. These tests need to be rigorous but also practical.

### Analysis-related Building blocks
#### Estimations
Market sizing etc...
What is market size of road maintenance in the US?
#### Quantitative Analyses
Getting the right number is the minimum - how you do this and what you do after you find it is as important. Also sometimes interviewer might hide data from you and you need to ask for it.
#### Chart Interpretation
See charts from already done analysis. Great candidates find more insights, communicate them better and develop better next steps.

### How to tie together

EX: An engineering firm just developed a sensor that predicts mechanical problems in cars following a
