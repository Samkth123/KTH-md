## The 6 building blocks of cases

mastering each building block is important.
Whenever get a task or question from interview, they are somehow related to one of these building blocks. Each can be solved by a step by step method here.

These can be learnt in isolation.
### Structuring-related Building Blocks

#### Brainstorming
Use issue tree to build a structured list of hypotheses and ideas, not throwing out random list of ideas or hypotheses without structure or priority.

Ex: Iron mining company seen revenue drop 30% last year despite heavy investments, what could explain that?

#### Frameworks
Frameworks are decision making plans - a list of questions you need to answered to make a decision and a systematic way of making sense of them. 
#### Hypothesis testing
Serveres to test the hypotheses you organized and prioritized when brainstorming. These tests need to be rigorous but also practical.

### Analysis-related Building blocks
#### Estimations
Market sizing etc...
What is market size of road maintenance in the US?
#### Quantitative Analyses
Getting the right number is the minimum - how you do this and what you do after you find it is as important. Also sometimes interviewer might hide data from you and you need to ask for it.
#### Chart Interpretation
See charts from already done analysis. Great candidates find more insights, communicate them better and develop better next steps.

### How to tie together

This is a simplified path.

Often obvious which building block the interviewers question is in, so very easy for you.

### Mindset

- Keep notes 

- You can get right answer but get rejected. You need to build a strong argument, not find one answer.
- Preparation is a case itself
	- Not use only easy cases to prepare, do the hard ones
- Be curious and ask why
	- interviewer loves curious candidates
	- Feeling by minute 5 of case should be i know i will get to answer, not hopefully figure out.
	- Thinking should be made before presenting framework not after
		- ask yourself why this segment why that, osv...
		- keep curiosity up and think about problem with why
- Be curious about feedback
	- dont take it at face value
	- why and how




## Estimations

Goal of estimation case is not to just pass it, but to show that you think as the consultant does.
- Also not unnormal for consultants to discuss an industry with someone much more experienced than them in it
- Therefore they need to understand it better

### Estimations (market sizing): The 5 step approach

1. Clarify scope
	1. Make sure you knwo what to estimate
2. Structure problem
	1. No numbers yet just say what you will do
3. Choose assumptions
	1. assign values to variables
4. Calculate
	1. get to answer
5. Check answer
	1. does it make sense? Compare to something else


#### Example
![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 09.27.02.png]]

My approach:
1. US population
2. Segment by age
3. Percentage of those who chew bubble gum
4. How often does each segment chew bubble gum
5. add it all together


Interviewer:

Clarify scope: FÖRSTÅ ALLTID NÅGOT OM MARKNADEN
- Only bubble gum like candy or also nicotine gum and such?

Interviewers approach:

![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 09.35.32.png]]


Does this make sense?
- If market is 9,2B and us population is 320 M, then each american spend approximately 30 dollars per year on bubble gum, which is between 1-3 meals a year
- Makes sense


### In depth

#### Clarify scope

- What unit does interviewer want you to estimate in?
	- Is market size nr of customer of nr of dollars?
	- If ask too late then interviewer will see you as consultant which wastes time by not asking right questions
- Beware of grey areas in the scope
	- ex Bubble gum only or also other utility gum in this question
	- Other example is TV market size
		- Common to look at how many TVs exist, replacement rate and get TV market size
		- But if you dont ask then you dont know if maybe TVs sold to businesses too or something like that too and not only consumers.
			- This is a important characteristic of a consultant

#### Structure problem

- Have interviewer understand full logic of what you are going to do before start estimating.
	- They can evaluate you properly on whatever they want to and you are on same team here, you need to try to help them and they will help you

- Use top down structures to make sure you are not leaving anything out and that the interviewer understands your ideas easily
- Explicitly state the algebra in your structure

#### Choose assumptions
- Based on logic and data
	- ex bubble gum want to know average yearly consumption per consumer
		- I chew 5 pieces a day, high frequency chew maybe 15 a day and low frequency 1-2 a day, and low frequency much more normal
	- This is IMPORTANT as it shows that you can build a quantitative model easily and even if the numbers are not that important it shows that you can understand stuff from data. 
- Focus on what matters
	- Show consultant that you focus on things that matter actually
	- If something is not that important, do not put too much time on it
		- ex penetration rate of bubble gum: Just come up with an answer and give rationalle behind it
			- if its something that is not intuitive, then you should just come up with something
- Get creative
	- as long as you use data and logic and structure
	- not hard and actually a bit fun
- Its OK to ask
	- ex if you do not know population of a specific country or such
	- if they say no then use a country of similar size or such

#### Calculate
- precise and efficient
	- dont make mistakes, but if make them need to catch them
	- take shortcuts
- Always reality check before start calculating

#### Check answer
This makes you standout from 95% of candidatees
- most people dont even know to do this

- Compare your value to something to get an idea of whether it makes sense or not
	- ex potential market for high protein potato chips
		- Lets say we come up with 5B
		- Then we can compare it to maybe whey market
		- OR
		- Lets say 5B means each American spend 1500 dollars a year on high protein chips, that makes no sense
- If have to change variables, go for variables that can change more!
	- Those also have the chance of being wrong more
	- in our ex: Bubble game penetration
- When interviewer asks you to check answer
	- dont check math only
	- use creativity and reality check your answer



### Drill 1 - nr of beds in brazil in dolalrs

Need to explain growth and replacement rate if use

![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 10.23.18.png]]

Mistakes include not doing comparisons:
- ex reality check with different stuff
	- How much of the market divided by population is the average persons spending on this?
		- Does that make sense?
	- What is minimum wage in brazil? Does it make sense to that

Drivers for sales of many things are the replacement rates and growth rates
- ==ALWAYS COMPARE IN THE REALITY CHECK==




## Brainstorming

ALWAYS STRUCTURED IN CONSULTING.

Always 3-4 brainstorming questions in cases, and important to be creative but having structure is much more important.
- So if ideas or hypothesis they want you to present, must be structured.

Its the first bulding block of the 6, and relates to s
### The 3 step approach
See it as "Hypothesis generation question"

Its impossible to get offer from top consulting firm is because they cant structure their brainstorming well
