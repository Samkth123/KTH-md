## The 6 building blocks of cases

mastering each building block is important.
Whenever get a task or question from interview, they are somehow related to one of these building blocks. Each can be solved by a step by step method here.

These can be learnt in isolation.
### Structuring-related Building Blocks

#### Brainstorming
Use issue tree to build a structured list of hypotheses and ideas, not throwing out random list of ideas or hypotheses without structure or priority.

Ex: Iron mining company seen revenue drop 30% last year despite heavy investments, what could explain that?

#### Frameworks
Frameworks are decision making plans - a list of questions you need to answered to make a decision and a systematic way of making sense of them. 
#### Hypothesis testing
Serveres to test the hypotheses you organized and prioritized when brainstorming. These tests need to be rigorous but also practical.

### Analysis-related Building blocks
#### Estimations
Market sizing etc...
What is market size of road maintenance in the US?
#### Quantitative Analyses
Getting the right number is the minimum - how you do this and what you do after you find it is as important. Also sometimes interviewer might hide data from you and you need to ask for it.
#### Chart Interpretation
See charts from already done analysis. Great candidates find more insights, communicate them better and develop better next steps.

### How to tie together

This is a simplified path.

Often obvious which building block the interviewers question is in, so very easy for you.

### Mindset

- Keep notes 

- You can get right answer but get rejected. You need to build a strong argument, not find one answer.
- Preparation is a case itself
	- Not use only easy cases to prepare, do the hard ones
- Be curious and ask why
	- interviewer loves curious candidates
	- Feeling by minute 5 of case should be i know i will get to answer, not hopefully figure out.
	- Thinking should be made before presenting framework not after
		- ask yourself why this segment why that, osv...
		- keep curiosity up and think about problem with why
- Be curious about feedback
	- dont take it at face value
	- why and how




## Estimations

Goal of estimation case is not to just pass it, but to show that you think as the consultant does.
- Also not unnormal for consultants to discuss an industry with someone much more experienced than them in it
- Therefore they need to understand it better

### Estimations (market sizing): The 5 step approach

1. Clarify scope
	1. Make sure you knwo what to estimate
2. Structure problem
	1. No numbers yet just say what you will do
3. Choose assumptions
	1. assign values to variables
4. Calculate
	1. get to answer
5. Check answer
	1. does it make sense? Compare to something else


#### Example
![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 09.27.02.png]]

My approach:
1. US population
2. Segment by age
3. Percentage of those who chew bubble gum
4. How often does each segment chew bubble gum
5. add it all together


Interviewer:

Clarify scope: FÖRSTÅ ALLTID NÅGOT OM MARKNADEN
- Only bubble gum like candy or also nicotine gum and such?

Interviewers approach:

![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 09.35.32.png]]


Does this make sense?
- If market is 9,2B and us population is 320 M, then each american spend approximately 30 dollars per year on bubble gum, which is between 1-3 meals a year
- Makes sense


### In depth

#### Clarify scope

- What unit does interviewer want you to estimate in?
	- Is market size nr of customer of nr of dollars?
	- If ask too late then interviewer will see you as consultant which wastes time by not asking right questions
- Beware of grey areas in the scope
	- ex Bubble gum only or also other utility gum in this question
	- Other example is TV market size
		- Common to look at how many TVs exist, replacement rate and get TV market size
		- But if you dont ask then you dont know if maybe TVs sold to businesses too or something like that too and not only consumers.
			- This is a important characteristic of a consultant

#### Structure problem

- Have interviewer understand full logic of what you are going to do before start estimating.
	- They can evaluate you properly on whatever they want to and you are on same team here, you need to try to help them and they will help you

- Use top down structures to make sure you are not leaving anything out and that the interviewer understands your ideas easily
- Explicitly state the algebra in your structure

#### Choose assumptions
- Based on logic and data
	- ex bubble gum want to know average yearly consumption per consumer
		- I chew 5 pieces a day, high frequency chew maybe 15 a day and low frequency 1-2 a day, and low frequency much more normal
	- This is IMPORTANT as it shows that you can build a quantitative model easily and even if the numbers are not that important it shows that you can understand stuff from data. 
- Focus on what matters
	- Show consultant that you focus on things that matter actually
	- If something is not that important, do not put too much time on it
		- ex penetration rate of bubble gum: Just come up with an answer and give rationalle behind it
			- if its something that is not intuitive, then you should just come up with something
- Get creative
	- as long as you use data and logic and structure
	- not hard and actually a bit fun
- Its OK to ask
	- ex if you do not know population of a specific country or such
	- if they say no then use a country of similar size or such

#### Calculate
- precise and efficient
	- dont make mistakes, but if make them need to catch them
	- take shortcuts
- Always reality check before start calculating

#### Check answer
This makes you standout from 95% of candidatees
- most people dont even know to do this

- Compare your value to something to get an idea of whether it makes sense or not
	- ex potential market for high protein potato chips
		- Lets say we come up with 5B
		- Then we can compare it to maybe whey market
		- OR
		- Lets say 5B means each American spend 1500 dollars a year on high protein chips, that makes no sense
- If have to change variables, go for variables that can change more!
	- Those also have the chance of being wrong more
	- in our ex: Bubble game penetration
- When interviewer asks you to check answer
	- dont check math only
	- use creativity and reality check your answer



### Drill 1 - nr of beds in brazil in dolalrs

Need to explain growth and replacement rate if use


![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 10.22.30.png]]


![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 10.23.18.png]]

Mistakes include not doing comparisons:
- ex reality check with different stuff
	- How much of the market divided by population is the average persons spending on this?
		- Does that make sense?
	- What is minimum wage in brazil? Does it make sense to that

Drivers for sales of many things are the replacement rates and growth rates
- ==ALWAYS COMPARE IN THE REALITY CHECK==




## Brainstorming

ALWAYS STRUCTURED IN CONSULTING.

Always 3-4 brainstorming questions in cases, and important to be creative but having structure is much more important.
- So if ideas or hypothesis they want you to present, must be structured.

Its the first bulding block of the 6, and first of the structure ones
### The 3 step approach
See it as "Hypothesis generation question"

Its impossible to get offer from top consulting firm is because they cant structure their brainstorming well

==Generating a list of hypotheses (or ideas) needs to be==
- **structured**
- **prioritized**
- **With good hypotheses / ideas**

Ex: Iron ore mining company has seen revenues drop 30% in last year despite heavy investments, what are plausible hypotheses that could explain that?
##### Example - good and bad answers
**==Bad answer:==**
Maybe
- demand has dropped
- there is a recesion going on
- steel mills arnt buying much because they accumulated inventory
- sales force is not doing a good job
- prices have dropped

This answer does have good ideas, but they dont contain the hypothesis that could be confirmed. If you answer brainstorming like this, you wont get offer.

==**Good answer:**==
Could be Volume or Avg Price dropping.
If volume, could be 3 things
- not producing enough
- market buying less so demand is down*
- market share is down and buying from competitors

if avg price down could be 
- maybe average market price down**
- maybe product mix changed from high value to low value prudcts
- maybe company doesnt have market price

Because market is cyclicle, i believe that the reason could be because of the demand * and that market price is down ** and we are heading into a recession. Do we have data on this?


The approach to be better than other candidates who just come up with random lists. Our goal is a structured prioriteized list of good ideas and hypotheses.

1. **Define and structure**
	1. Define specifically
	2. Structure with MECE issue trees
	3. Make structure problem-specific.
		1. If you can, make the problem a metric. ex: If want help to make product better, what is better? 
		2. If cant reduce to metric (a number), what does better mean? Is it faster, stronger?
2. **Prioritize drivers**
	1. Take context and numbers in case into consideration
	2. Think which driver have highest impact
	3. Think which driver has higher likelihood / feasibility of working
3. **Generate hypotheses.** (Usually, candidates start here, which is a mistake) 
	1. State the obvious (because often clients ask about obvious things)
	2. Think outside the box
	3. Stay practical when you give an idea. Creative ideas are useless if they cant be implemented in reality.

**Example**:
MAD, a local Martial Arts Dojo has recently seen its revenue decline sharply. What could have happened?
- (Basically saying can you come up with a structured list of hypotheses?)

**1.DEFINE AND STRUCTURE**
1. Define 
	1. Revenue is from subscription and gear right?
	2. MECE tree
		1. Drop in # customers or drop in cash per customer
			1. # customers (Might have more churn than new customers)
				1. if customers down either customers leave more often or 
				2. we get less customers (cant make up for customers lost)
			2. drop in cash per customer
				1. drop in average monthly fees or
				2. drop in cash from gear sold per customer
2. MECE (basically own buckets osv) ^^
3. Usually you use price * quantity for revenue, but need to adjust it here so its problem specific. **MUST DO THIS EVERYTIME TO NOT BE REPETITIVE AND JUST SAY GENERIC FRAMEWORK and shows business sense** 
![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 20.05.50.png]]
**2.Prioritize driver** (**==ALWAYS ASK FOR DATA, IF NOT GIVEN DATA SAY THAT YOU WISH YOU WOULD HAVE DATA OTHERWISE THEY WILL THINK YOU ARE ASSUMING TOO MUCH==**)
1. Importnat because you can be 80/20
2. At 4 drivers at end of tree, which ones are more important?
3. Revenues have dropped really fast, so what could make it drop so fast?
	1. all 4 (3 tho) buckets are important but not the gear sale part
	2. Most likely that customer acquisition dropped really bad is jot the case (because even if we did bad job at marketing we would still have our customers)
	3. Also changing prices should not have such a drastic effect
	4. Hypothesis is that bunch of our drivers dropped out for some reason
4. So say to interviewer that if we dont have data, we should not be loosing that much revenue even if no new customers or gear sales.
5. If our customers are leaving more often, this could be due to
	1. Them leaving for our customers
	2. Them going to other exercise
	3. Or just stopped excersizing altogether

IMPORTANT:
- Give ratioanle why you are prioritizing specific bucket
- Dont say that cause is not in other buckets, but that you want to investigate this one first

![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 20.11.32.png]]

**3.Generate hypothesis**
Start by priority buckets, but then generate others for the other buckets as well.

Ex:
For competition bucket: 
- We might have new competitor which are clients are glocking to because of best trainer
- Maybe our business has changed and we fired a trainer which everyone loved or changed location
For physical exercise
- maybe was just a trend to do martials arts
- Something maybe happened and parents scared of martial arts

Stopped paying for exercise:
- economic crisis
- pandemic

Now go to other buckets based on priority.

#### How to finish question
How would you transform the hypothesis into solution?
Two ways:

1. Quantitive analysis + hypothesis testing 
	1. So lets say in the MMA example we went through all brainstorming.
	2. We would then say that we want to collect data to which revenue driver dropped, and that i want to see new customers, customer acquisitions, etc.
	3. When we know which is the reason ex if we are losing customers
		1. we would then go try and understand why they are going to others
		2. ex call them and ask or use surveys to see why
2. Interviewer tells you that you are right about hypothesis and now you need to find solution, so you need new brainstorming then.
	1. Lets say interviewer says that yes its fad market
		1. then we ask how many of current customers are going to leave too, and how will we keep them from leaving us
		2. Also how can we expand our business to fad business osv..

So we test the hypothesis before we even start brainstorming.


#### Frequently asked questions
1. when to use brainstorming?
	1. When interviewr asks for list
	2. or when asked open "why do you think" or "what "
2. how to handle what else questions?
3. no time to think? No paper allowed? just say whats on my mind? Should i still be structurd
