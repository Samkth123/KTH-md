Paper about how people dont understand public srecice innovation and think they are risk averse, but this paper shows how innovation occurs in a range of organisational and service settings and is shaped by multiple institutional lgoics. THey look at hybrid social enterprise orgs and explore how their innovative activities are shaped by the co existing lgoics of the public, market and civil society sectors.

This paper is going to show how differnet logics are combined.

How do co-existing logics shape approaches to public service innovation in hybrid organisations?

They focus on innovation potential of newly created hybrid social enterprise (SE) orgs that span traditional boundaries of public, private-for-profit and civil society sectors by recombining logics that traditionally were seen as distinctive to one of these 3 realms.

In this paper, social enterprises (SEs) are specifically hybrid organizations that operate between the public, private, and civil society sectors.
SEs
- legal companies
- core social purpose that is achieved by trading in goods or services
- winning contracts from the public sector
- get promoted by governments (especially since liberal regime state involvement is low)

Researchers use differnet ways of working of “logics”
- Incumbent public sector logic is the traditional way public service has worked - beureaucracy, regulations and standard procedures
- first challenger logic is market/business where bring in business thinking and focus on competition which makes stuff more efficient
- secon chellenger logic is civil society that focuses on social value (helping people) and democratic engagement and involving everytone

Interesting part is how they interact and conflict 

#### Theoretical contect of innovation in public services

Public sector practice has asymmetric incentives where unsuccessful innovations are punished more severly than succesfull ones.

We dont understand research gap in orgs delivering public services to operate in competitive market and blance different conflicting goals:

Example: How can a hospital be profitable AND provide universal care AND involve the community?

The solution is use “institutional perspectives” to study


**Hybrid SEs have advantages** in addressing complex and under-served needs of people as they can combine logics of public service and social value with logics of private enteprises and markets.

Previous studies looked at tensions between logics and marketization of nonprofits give rise to danger of “mission drift” where social ends and social innovation are compromised by logics of business and market.


The results section analyzes how differnet institutional logics interact in public service innovation

3 main logics at play in innovations
- state/public sector logic
    - emphasis on universal healthservice as a good
    - public accountability and regulation
    - integration of sergices
    - commissioners (commissioners are key public sector officials who are responsible for planning, purchasing, and monitoring healthcare services on behalf of their local populations) playing a key role in supporting innovation
- Market logic
    - competitive bidding for contracts
    - focus on financial savings and efficiency
    - generating trading income and surpluses (normally seen as bad if comes from taxpayer money)
    - diversification into new revenue sources
- Civil Society logic
    - Focus on social goals and community wellbeing
    - Co-operative practices and knowledge sharing
    - Use of volunteers (can be good and bad tho)
    - Democratic participation by staff and users

The study identified three key areas where the logics interplayed within organizations:
- Leadership & Culture
    - Leaders able to combine different logic styles in mangement style
    - Staff empowered to experiment and take risks (hard in public sector but more normal in heirarchical and market)
    - Building diverse teams with different capabilities
    - Some tension between business and social objectives
- Financial mangement
    - greater control over budgets enabled risk taking (as become more independent? and no public sector budgeting rules + could keep surplusses)
    - Surplus generated from contracts reinvested in innovation
    - democratic involvement in deciding how to reinvest surpluses
- Knowledge management
    - Tension between sharing knowledge (civil society logic) vs protective competitive advantage (market logic)
    - Commissioners encouraging knowledge sharing
    - some reluctance to share with competitors

Three key stakeholder relationships shaped how logics interplayed
- Funders
    - positive relationships with sympathetic commissioners
    - Tension between short term savings and long term social impact
    - use of social impact measures to demonstrate value
- Service users
    - greater responseivess to user needs
    - co production of services with users
    - shift in terminology from patients to customers
- Delivery partners
    - collab across 3 sectors private public and civil society
    - need to build legitimacy as independent providers
    - challenge to dominnat logics of partner orgs

Tensions did remain about
- short vs long term objectives
- sharing vs protecting knowledge
- business growth vs social mission
- use of volunteers vs paid staff


Organizations
- need to build cultures supporting multiple logics
- importance of diverse teams and capabilities
- clear strategies for managing knowledge and resources
- building constructive relationships with commissioners

Policy
- supporting innovation through funding decisions
- encouraging knowledg sharing while respecting competition
- balacing efficiency with social value
- enabling smaller organizations to participate
- support scaling of successful innovations
