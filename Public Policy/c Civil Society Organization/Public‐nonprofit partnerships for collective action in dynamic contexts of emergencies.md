Article about disaster and PNP

Orgs that get things done will not be hierarchical pyramids with most control on top. They will be systems or interlaced webs of tension where power is loose and centers of decisions are plural. Decision making is more intricate

Orgs can go into partnership with eachother if they see a critical strategic interdependence with other orgs in their environment where one org has resources or capabilities that the other does not posses.

PNPs are based on recognition of interdependencies across sectors and organizations.

Creative action by public organizations can foster social capital, linking mobilzed nonprofits and citizens to enhance efficacy of governemnt. Horizontal networks help develop social capital which in turn fosters a healthier society

Social capital approach gives new ways of combining private social infrastructure with public policies. Massive changes that occur are:
- Escalting needs for information and learning
- Pressing demands for innovation and continuous improvement
- Shift to flat org designs
- tigether integration of orgs with networks of other orgs

Social capital is not fixed, and dependso n the context it is in. Its basically networks/relationships/trust that exist within a community or org

PNP: When public orgs collaborate with nonprofits, they build social capital in the community as people are encouraged to actively participate in communities and set priorites and develop programs together which strengthens social ties and trust.

Public policies can enhance social capital by promoting collabs like through pnps

Communities that have strong working relationships on daily basis work better in disasters as well. The building of trust between government and nonprofits is best done before an emergency situation. 

Communication is important as an informed community is better able to adapt its behaviour appropriately to the exposure of risk

A disaster is defined as a social disruption. It constitutes a significant disruption to public life.

Social networks can enhance performance of collective action
1. When orgs work together there is trust between them. This reduces transaction costs, which means that orgs can collaborate more easily without all formal agreements and negotiations. Ex also all regulations in hospitals where dropped during covid
2. Trust and reciprocity works as informal social control ex if i do something for you you will want to do for me back, so that is a form of control
3. Rapid dissemination of information  - social networks makes it easy to spread info quickly
4. Social capital also improves access to resources among network members

Tight coupling means a system where different components are closely interconnected so if there is a failure in one part it will be problems in others as well. If we have this its inevitable we will have accidents

PNP is not only administrative matter, but the partnership process also encourages collective action and capacity building, more effective decision making and implementation and more community ivolvement.

Key factors in disaster repsonse and role of pnps
- Need matching organizational design with interdependence on different entities and decentralized communication
- flow of communication important
- pnps bridge gaps in service delivery during emergencies, and require strong trust and collaboration between government agencies and nonprofit sector.
- nonprofits mobilized civic participation in 9/11
