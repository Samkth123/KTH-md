==Summarized this is about how the state today, whether its a welfare state or not, depends on its history==
- Example in Sweden, the church was abolished, and much of the churches responsibility fell on the state to provide that welfare to the people


Social capital refers to the networks, relationships, trust, and norms that exist within a community or society, which enable individuals and groups to work together for mutual benefit

Social capital & NGOs are important in political and ecnonimc life.

These organizations were defined by five key characteristics:
1. Organizations (institutionalized to some degree)
2. Private (separate from government)
3. Non-profit-distributing (profits not returned to owners or directors)
4. Self-governing (able to control their own activities)
5. Voluntary (involving significant voluntary participation)

The quote from Seibel (1990) means that nonprofit organizations play a dual role in society. They are not just focused on providing goods or services (like charities, social services, or education), but they also play an important role in social and political coordination. This refers to the idea that nonprofits help to organize and mobilize people, foster cooperation, and influence social and political outcomes.
- As a consequence, they do not float freely in social space. Rather, they are firmly "embedded" in prevailing social and economic structures, often serving as "the knots within networks of elites with reputation, finance, and power."

The passage highlights the historical relationship between church and state and how this shaped the role of voluntary institutions (like nonprofits) in different countries, including Sweden.

Specifically, it says that in Sweden, where Church authorities were “==domesticated==" (i.e., the Church’s influence was reduced or controlled by the state), **the state absorbed much of the welfare functions that had previously been managed by religious organizations**. As a result, voluntary institutions (nonprofit organizations, charities, etc.) played a smaller role, particularly in providing human services.

This contrasts with countries like Germany (under Bismarck), where the church maintained a more independent or cooperative role with the state. In such contexts, voluntary institutions continued to have a stronger presence even as state-sponsored welfare systems grew

The terms Social Democratic, Liberal, Statist, and Corporatist refer to different models of nonprofit sector development (or "nonprofit regimes"), shaped by a country's welfare state and the relationship between the state and civil society (including nonprofits).
- The models are based on low/high government social welfare spending (how much the state spends on welfare services like hleathcare and education) & low/high scale of the nonprofit sector (how big the sector is)
- Social democratic model:
    - High government social welfare spending (state plats centrial role in providing social welfare protection like universal healthcare and unemployment help)
    - Scale of nonprofit sector is small (since government already provides these things, but they focus more on political and social activities and recreational activities instead)
    - eg Sweden
- Liberal model
    - low government social welfare spending
    - large nonprofit sector as they need to step in to replace government here ex soup kitchen in USA
    - Typically emerges in societies where middle class elements dominate and neither elites or working class have much say
- Coropratist model
    - strong state involvement but partnership with nonprofits
    - nonprofits have key role in maintaining stability and supporting elites
    - The state works with nonprofits to maintain social order, prevent radical demands. Nonprofits grow with increased state welfare.
- Statist model
    - Strong state acting on its own behalf or behalf of elites
    - nonprofit activity is highly constrained
    - state maintains control over welfare, with limited nonprofit inolvement due to centralized power

In liberal and social democratic regimes, nonprofit sector is financed heavily by charitable contributions.

"social origins" refers to a theoretical approach that explains the development of certain social and political outcomes—such as the strength or nature of nonprofit sectors—by looking at the historical, political, and social conditions

* "Social origins" in this context refers to the historical and political factors that shape the development of welfare systems and the nonprofit sector in different countries. The theory posits that the state's involvement in welfare and the relative size of the nonprofit sector are deeply influenced by historical factors like:
    * The role of the working class in politics (e.g., in Sweden, the strong influence of working-class parties led to a robust welfare state).
    * The role of the Church and its relationship with the state (e.g., in Italy, the Church's control over welfare was replaced by state control).
    * The balance of power between state, church, and social movements over time.
