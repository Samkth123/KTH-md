==Summarized this is about how the state today, whether its a welfare state or not, depends on its history==
- Example in Sweden, the church was abolished, and much of the churches responsibility fell on the state to provide that welfare to the people


Social capital refers to the networks, relationships, trust, and norms that exist within a community or society, which enable individuals and groups to work together for mutual benefit

Social capital & NGOs are important in political and ecnonimc life.

These organizations were defined by five key characteristics:
1. Organizations (institutionalized to some degree)
2. Private (separate from government)
3. Non-profit-distributing (profits not returned to owners or directors)
4. Self-governing (able to control their own activities)
5. Voluntary (involving significant voluntary participation)

The quote from Seibel (1990) means that nonprofit organizations play a dual role in society. They are not just focused on providing goods or services (like charities, social services, or education), but they also play an important role in social and political coordination. This refers to the idea that nonprofits help to organize and mobilize people, foster cooperation, and influence social and political outcomes.
- As a consequence, they do not float freely in social space. Rather, they are firmly "embedded" in prevailing social and economic structures, often serving as "the knots within networks of elites with reputation, finance, and power."

The passage highlights the historical relationship between church and state and how this shaped the role of voluntary institutions (like nonprofits) in different countries, including Sweden.

Specifically, it says that in Sweden, where Church authorities were “==domesticated==" (i.e., the Church’s influence was reduced or controlled by the state), **the state absorbed much of the welfare functions that had previously been managed by religious organizations**. As a result, voluntary institutions (nonprofit organizations, charities, etc.) played a smaller role, particularly in providing human services.

This contrasts with countries like Germany (under Bismarck), where the church maintained a more independent or cooperative role with the state. In such contexts, voluntary institutions continued to have a stronger presence even as state-sponsored welfare systems grew

The terms Social Democratic, Liberal, Statist, and Corporatist refer to different models of nonprofit sector development (or "nonprofit regimes"), shaped by a country's welfare state and the relationship between the state and civil society (including nonprofits).
- The models are based on low/high government social welfare spending (how much the state spends on welfare services like hleathcare and education) & low/high scale of the nonprofit sector (how big the sector is)
- Social democratic model:
    - High government social welfare spending (state plats centrial role in providing social welfare protection like universal healthcare and unemployment help)
    - Scale of nonprofit sector is small (since government already provides these things, but they focus more on political and social activities and recreational activities instead)
    - eg Sweden
- Liberal model
    - low government social welfare spending
    - large nonprofit sector as they need to step in to replace government here ex soup kitchen in USA
    - Typically emerges in societies where middle class elements dominate and neither elites or working class have much say
- Coropratist model
    - strong state involvement but partnership with nonprofits
    - nonprofits have key role in maintaining stability and supporting elites
    - The state works with nonprofits to maintain social order, prevent radical demands. Nonprofits grow with increased state welfare.
- Statist model
    - Strong state acting on its own behalf or behalf of elites
    - nonprofit activity is highly constrained
    - state maintains control over welfare, with limited nonprofit inolvement due to centralized power

In liberal and social democratic regimes, nonprofit sector is financed heavily by charitable contributions.

"social origins" refers to a theoretical approach that explains the development of certain social and political outcomes—such as the strength or nature of nonprofit sectors—by looking at the historical, political, and social conditions

* "Social origins" in this context refers to the historical and political factors that shape the development of welfare systems and the nonprofit sector in different countries. The theory posits that the state's involvement in welfare and the relative size of the nonprofit sector are deeply influenced by historical factors like:
    * The role of the working class in politics (e.g., in Sweden, the strong influence of working-class parties led to a robust welfare state).
    * The role of the Church and its relationship with the state (e.g., in Italy, the Church's control over welfare was replaced by state control).
    * The balance of power between state, church, and social movements over time.

Left to do: examples of coropratist and statist regimes

The emergence of democracy, or what we would call a vibrant “civil society” is due to:
1. Royal absolutism held in check by strong elites (monarchs authroity is limited by wealthy landowners)
2. The emergence of vigorous and independent urban middle class to challenge powers of traditional elites
3. Solution to agrarian problem - agricultural reforms free majority of population from dependence on farming

In liberal model, low social welfare spending is associated with strong nonprofit sector where opposition of landed elite / middle class never happened.

Opposite extreme is social democratic model. Here welfare is given much from state, and no room is left for nonprfits. Here most likely working class powers have put out good efforts. This does not mean the nonprofits are not active, but they are instead active in other ways than in liberal. If in liberal its like much soup kitchens, in social democratic they are part of political and social and recrational activities. Ex. Hallen IF.

In between the two above models are the others. Corporatist is basically like liberal where NGOs are strong, but they also have strong social welfare spending. The government keeps good contact with the NGOs to keep support from strong powerful social elites like churches and aristocracy. They basically work with them so more extreme demands dont come up. In corporatist regimes nonprofits grow with the government, but in liberal regimes nonprofit shrinks if government take on more responsibiltity.

Fourth model is statist model. Here we have both low government welfare spending and low NGO activity. This is as government keeps centralized control and might be religious regime.

Hypothesis:
- storng middleclass & middleclass + landed elites not wanting challenge - liberal regime wins as they have low welfare put people take care of eachoher
- when working class stronger than middle class its scial democratic due to scoial welfare to working class and small nonprofits ecor
- landed elements strong and confron pressure from middle and working calss, this is corporatist as get good welfare and governemtn works with nonprofits  as its 2 v 1
- conservative elements remain in control of state, a statist most likely happens where nothing given to citizens.

Social origins also important. In liberal and sociodemo regimes nonprofits are financed by private contributions (unions normal here?). In corporatist the good collaboration between nonprofits and government makes state help more prevelant in nonprofits. In statist no money is expected for the nonprofits.
Basically
- if liberal/sociodemo funding is from private
- corporatist funding is from government mostly
- statist none, so might take fees as nonprofits


#### Social origins theory


Super-Short Summary:
* Social Origins Theory: Nonprofit sectors are shaped by social and political histories. The theory identifies four models:
    1. Liberal (U.S., U.K.): Low state welfare, large nonprofit sector, supported by middle class.
    2. Social Democratic (Sweden, Italy): High state welfare, small nonprofit sector, with nonprofits focusing on advocacy.
    3. Corporatist (Germany, France): State works closely with nonprofits, especially religious ones, to provide welfare.
    4. Statist (Japan): State dominance, low nonprofit sector, and reliance on corporate welfare.
* Financing & Anomalies: The theory explains nonprofit revenue sources:
    * Liberal: Private philanthropy.
    * Corporatist: Government funding.
    * Statist: Fees.
    * Social Democratic: Predicted private giving, but fees are more prominent.
* German Example: The German nonprofit sector’s focus on health and social services (not education) is rooted in historical struggles between the state and the Catholic Church, leading to a corporatist welfare system.

The Social Origins Theory explains the development of nonprofit sectors in different countries through their unique social and political histories, leading to four main "regimes" or models:
1. Liberal Regimes (e.g., U.S., U.K.): These countries have low government welfare spending and large nonprofit sectors, shaped by a strong urban middle class. The U.S. is a "purer" liberal model, while the U.K. combines liberal and social democratic elements, particularly in healthcare.
2. Social Democratic Regimes (e.g., Sweden, Italy): These countries feature extensive government welfare and smaller nonprofit sectors, with nonprofits focusing on advocacy and community roles rather than direct service provision.
3. Corporatist Regimes (e.g., Germany, France): The state collaborates closely with nonprofit organizations, often religious, to provide welfare services. In Germany, this partnership is rooted in historical agreements with churches.
4. Statist Regimes (e.g., Japan): The state dominates welfare provision with minimal involvement from nonprofits, relying on corporate welfare.
The theory also explains nonprofit finance patterns: liberal regimes rely on private philanthropy, corporatist regimes on government funding, and statist regimes on fees. Social democratic regimes, contrary to expectations, show a prominence of fees, though private giving is still notable.
Overall, the theory helps explain cross-country differences in nonprofit sector size, function, and financing based on historical and social contexts.
