Innovation in Governance and Public Services - past and present

How extensive does a change be to be seen as an innovation?

Usually we look at product innovation, but innovation in governance and services are more ambiguous. Its not physical, but rather a change in the relationship between service providers and their users.

Innovations have to be **percieved as new by a proportion of key stakeholders**. This socially constructed perspective is **useful approach to public sector innovation** across a range of services.

Innovation may inclucde reinvention or adaption to another context, location, or time period.

**The diffusion of innovation** (sometimes called dissemination, or spread of good or promising practices) to other orgs is particularly **important for the public sector**
- here is a **difference between public and private** sector as innovation in private sector is mainly about gaining a compettitive advantage and restricting knowledge sharing, while in public sector drivers is to achieve widespread improvement to increase public value
- such public goals can be enhanced through collaboration efforts ex STAF in FPL

Innovations are defined as “New ideas that work” and “novelty in action”, and they emphasise that innovation is not just a new idea but a new practice.


A innovation is an innovation if
- new to org
- large enough to affect operations
- general enough in effects
- durbale enough to impact org character
- must “appreciably affect the operations” 
Invention is creation of new ideas, but innovation is the practical implementation of new ideas into practice

Public sector innovation characteristics
- Service based nature
    - often not physical
    - changes in relationships between providers and uders
    - requires judgement about processes and outcomes
- Diffusion importance
    - Adaption to other contexts
    - transfer between orgs is vital
    - reinvention often necessary for local context

Types of innovations
- product innovation
- srevice innovation ex online tax forms
- process innovation ex administrative reorganization
- Position innovation ex new contexts or user
- strategic innovation is new goals or purposes of org ex community policing 
- governance innovation is new forms of citizen engagement

Begreppet New Public Management etablerades under 1990-talet och kan enkelt beskrivas som en allmän förändring av hur offentlig sektorn skulle styras och organiseras. Den drivande idén var att omforma offentlig sektor till att mer fungera enligt marknadsprinciper

3 competing paradigms
- Traditional public administration
    - post war to early 1980s
    - environment stable
    - population view homogeneous
    - Aproach was legislative, beureacratic, rule based and state and producer centered
    - innovation based on nationsliation of industries, new town develpoment
- New public mangement
    - 1980s onwards
    - competitive environemnt
    - atomized population view
    - Very market driven appraoch and customer and efficency centered
    - innovation focus on org form, business processes, customer service and market
- Networked governance
    - current/emerging
    - environment is conitnously changing
    - population view is diverse
    - volatile and risk prone problems
    - Approach is network and parntership based and civil society shaped
    - Innovation occurs both at central and local levels, focusing on transformational change, and emphasis on continuous improvement

Innovation improvement relationship matrix

Q1 no innovation no improvement
- stable environments and no changes needed
- Org inertia and failure to recognize need for change and paralysis in action

Q2 improvement without innovation
- focus on small incremental change
- changes not large enough to consititute innovation
- continous improvement methodology
- can lead to substantial change over time

Q3 innovation without improvement
- failed innovation rates are high 30-95% in private sector
- public sector potentially higher risk
- more options but no service improvement
- innovation without value addition
- learning curve effects such as temportary performance decrease, operational adjustment period and implementation challenges

Q4 innovation with improvement
- characterized by successful implementation, noticeable improvements in outputs and outcomes, sustianable positive change 


Looking at the paper, the direct opposite of rule-based logic would be what's described under the New Public Management (NPM) and Networked Governance paradigms - specifically an outcomes or results-based approach.

**Rule-based logic** = Focus on HOW things are done (following correct procedures/processes) **Results-based logic** = Focus on WHAT is achieved (outcomes/effectiveness) - but they still focus on how things are acheived too, but here efficient and market driven process is important

In NPM the population are seen as customers and environment is competitive.


According to the paper, here are the key differences between New Public Management (NPM) and Networked Governance:
New Public Management:
* Context: Competitive market environment
* Views population as: Atomized customers
* Needs defined through: Market wants
* Strategy: Market and customer-centered
* Governance through: Markets
* Managers are: Efficiency maximizers
* Population role: Customers
* Focus: Individual service user satisfaction
Networked Governance:
* Context: Continuously changing environment
* Views population as: Diverse citizens
* Needs seen as: Complex, volatile, risky
* Strategy: Shaped by civil society
* Governance through: Networks and partnerships
* Managers are: "Explorers"
* Population role: Co-producers
* Focus: Creating public value through collaboration
Main differences:
1. NPM sees everything through market/customer lens, while Networked Governance emphasizes partnerships and collaboration
2. NPM focuses on individual customer satisfaction, while Networked Governance aims for broader public value
3. NPM uses market mechanisms, while Networked Governance uses networks and partnerships
4. NPM views citizens as customers, while Networked Governance sees them as co-producers
So while NPM focuses on making public services more business-like and market-driven, Networked Governance focuses on creating collaborative networks between different actors to address complex problems.
