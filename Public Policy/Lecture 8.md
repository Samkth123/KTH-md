##### Procurement trends and phenomena

The process of acquiring goods, services or work from external sources to meet a orgs needs. It involves identifying requirements, sourcing suppliers and managing contracts to ensure the right product or services are delivered at the right time, quality and cost.

This is the basic answer, but missing innovation

What is the role of procurement and how to make change?

Procurement has not had seat at the table before, but might now be able to have?
- procurement officer usually one step behind and report to CFO rather than CEO

Backsourcing
- company
    - monetary gains not realized
    - transactional costs
- public
    - accountability
    - cant just shut down failing part of org like private can
    - need to bring back inhouse^

##### procurement crash course

Procurement scope
- Procuring from first tier supplier in upstream so focial firm can sell to first teir custmomers in downstream

What do companies buy
- direct material ex bildelar
- indirect material ex IT equipment and fuel and office suppliers
- services ex consulting and administrative
- investments ex machinery

Who do public companies buy
- municipality ex staff for kitchen in schools
- region is trains and stuff
- hard to see in municipality because so much you are buying


How does procurement work?
- spend-category strategy
- vendor selection and negotiation
- purchase requisition approval
- purchase order generation
- invoice
- payment processing
- vendor management ( supplier management)

if look at source to contract
- spend-category strategy
- vendor selection and negotiation
- Here we need to define requirements, consdolidate needs, identify suppliers, market dynamics, set sourcing strategy, and the delivery is:
    - requirements
    - volume
    - strategy

Starts with business requirements - procurement guy focuses on business owner and his needs
- developing business requirements are the most important part of procurement
 How to influence supplier cost - the iceberg example
- commercial management is the tip (price)
- specification management (if i define a 16pro i will but vs iphone 12)
    - u have influence on cost when you do specification management
- Demand management (how much do i need)
- Process management (how efficient does it have to be)


Step 2 i prposal, neogtiation and slection of supplier
- Here 

steg 3 är implement and manage 
- Its about cost, the value you can create and risk
- its more than just settling the contract, its about how manage and develop and innovate during the contract period
- Delivety is implementation, value creation and risk amnagement


3P in supplier relationship management
This is basially what kind of supplier do i have and what kind of relationship do i want with them?
- Progressive - calue creation and innovation from working together (here utilize suppliers into focus on value creation)
    - supplier innovation management
- Productive - perofrmance improvement in quality, efficiency and effectiveness (try to reduce costs, increase quality and efficency)
    - supplier performance management
- Protective - risk reduction, brand protection and secruity of supply (Corporate motivation here is no risk)
    - supplier risk management

Lot of time is spent on managing supplier relations if have risk, want innovation or want cost fix - usually industries such as Retail

Strategic sourcing is mostly public orgs

Ordering cycle is mostly focus of private


Downstream is customer driven
Upstream is suppliers


Allt över var typ private?

Public procurement process
1. is a purchase necessary?
2. Analysing the needs and the market
3. The requirements are compiled in the tender documents
4. Advertising the procurement
5. Supplier submit tenders
6. Examining the tenders
7. Award notice and contract

What are the differences between private and public procurement and why?
- public driven on value
- public procurement invited for all, not private
- Regulations in public more than private
- Public cant have super tight collab with a company but private can have but also same with private?
- In private company can procure child work even, but in public not same as not only important what you get but also how you get it
- public entities have tighter budget and might not be able to upkeep relations and maintane them
- public and private procurement have different drivers as public is to make it good for all while in business its on making money
- public transparent 

Purpose of public procurement
- safeguards tax funds nad promotes fair ocmpetition
- ensures transparency and accountability in spending public money
- contributes to sustainable societal development

Key differences between public and private sector procurement
- public procurement is governed by stricter rules due to the use of public funds
- public entities cannot directly approach suppliers but must follow formal procedures
- The process often takes longer than private sector procurement, particularly for large purchases

Sustainability and innovation in public procurement
- Procurement can drive societal change by prioritizing socially and environmentally sustainbale products
- Encourages innovation by leveraging suppliers capabilities to develop new solutions

Leigslation governing public procurement
- All public sector purchasing including rent and leasing is subject ot procurement laws
- different rules apply based on the value and type of procurement
- even minor purchases ex 1 sek fall under procurement regulations


Grej om innovation - Behöver inte vara användbart, så länge det är nytt- ex glödlampor gjordes så nra att ingen köpte, då var en innovation att göra lamporna sämre så att folk behöver köpa mer

Procurement Strategy
- wide spread of categories in publi rather than private. 
- in public can be healthcare to snow to children, while in private its mostly e IT, proffessional services etc
- in public you cant build lots of competence in so many different areas and this is a large challenge, and you can see how little is left for supplier management
- ex Volvo has so many people in procurement and they have a limited nr of categories, but they have deep relationship to suppliers becuase they innovative so much like new trucks
- in public they focus on first part which is getting the contract, then they go to the next category ex healthcare, beause dont have time to nurture what they bought
- However will need category strategy

Procurement category strategy
- READ CRAJLIC MATRIX PRUCHASING MOST BECOME SUPPLY MANAGEMENT OSV:..
- Everyone in procurement know about Peter Krajjic matrix
- In a bank IT products and services is very important. THis will be in strategic items becasue has high business impact and also high risk and supply chain complexity. Also big spend money wise as hires more engineers than bankers.
- In “Leverage items” it is facility services, as banks have lots of offices and services around their offices. This has high business impact but has low complexity and risk. This is a big spend in money wise.
    - innovative to be more efficient
- “Non-strategic items” are professional services ex consultants. They have low business impact and also low supply chain complexity and risk


How will strategy and collaboration look like in the different quadrants?  With whom do you innovate? How do you collaborate with your suppliers?

How would a public procurement category “footprint” look like?
