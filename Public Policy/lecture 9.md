What is school management and school leadership

#### Guest lecture: Systematic quality work in schooling: The case of turnaround schools

How is a school governed? Who decides over whom?

Nordic model - welfare state principles and local autonomy in education governance

swedish system - highly decentralized. The parliament and overment define national curricula while central authroties, munuciplaities and insittuionts ex independent schools orgs, ensure that educational activiites align with the legislative framework

chlanges arise in tensions between the policies osv


Research area: HOw to turn around underperforming schools

linear relationships between school performance for kids and parents education. The higher education parents have the higher the school education for kids

higher performing schools are characterized by
- a school district with a strong focus on systematic quality assurance
- a principal who focuses on the core mission ie students learning
- teachers who collaborate (well)
- high academic expectations on pupils


Comparative qualitative analysis QCA
- a qulaitative method for medium to large n systematic case comparison
- identifies necessary and sufficient conditions by process of comparativ analysis and reduction

Schools need to be conextualized aka they are all very different or its reverse where its like students motivated or teachers good will work out everything
- none of these extremes work, need a middle thing

Added contexual moderators
- change pressure (absolute low-performing)
	- ex: Skola i bromma som går bra men ändå under snittet för sitt område har lägre change pressure än ortens skolla som rankas sveriges sämsta skola
- Urban/non-urban school context

Looked at if school performed well but in their student demographic they were bad, they could be a turn around school.

3 pathways to school turnaround
- Borrom up turnaround- techer collaboration in conjunction with the principal when the school is under change pressure
- Bypass turnaround - school district in conjunction with high academic expectations (change pressure irrelevant) and the principal is not focussing on core operations
- Leeway turnaround - School District in conjunction with principal when not under cahnge pressure, and there is a lack of teacher collaboration
- Non-turnaround - more prevelant in urvan contexts, the abscence of teacher collaboration is key









On Thursday, Governo will be back to present project areas you can choose between for your group assignment, all related to making Stockholm a _Smart City._
