Article is about how hybrid organisation who have competing institutional logics internally manage the logics they embody

A hybrid organization is a type of organization that blends different organizational models or structures to achieve multiple objectives, often combining elements of both profit-driven and social or mission-driven goals. In other words, hybrid organizations typically seek to pursue both financial success and social or environmental impact, rather than focusing exclusively on one or the other.

A **social enterprise** is an organization that operates with the primary goal of addressing a **social, environmental, or cultural issue**, while also striving to be financially sustainable

Just as social enterprises need to balance between making profits for owners vs reinvesting, or putting money into efficient workers vs caring volunteers, hybrid organisations need to find a way to deal with the multiple demands to which they are exposed. This article explores how they may do so.

Hybrid are not only organisations blending market and social logics, they are ppp’s incorporating elements from state, market and civil society logics, also can be biotech companies incoprotating science and market logics.

The growing pervasiveness of hybdrids is because of ==A pluralistic institutional environment,== which is a setting where multiple diverse groups, interests, values, and perspectives coexist and influence the workings of the institution. ==In such an environment, power and decision-making are distributed across various actors, rather than concentrated in the hands of a single group or authority.==
- Here companies are exposed to different taken for granted concepts of what goals are and also how to legitimately reach them and how to even be seen as legitimate
- In such an environment hybrid organisations are good because they incorporate many different aspects of these elements and can tend to a wider variety of people.
- Problem is that many of these institutional logics might be conflicting to eachother
- this leads to coalitions inside the company who embody the different logics and fight eachother — effectively bringing institutional conflict inside the company
- Hybrids that are exposed to longterm institutional pluralism face these challenges even more of fighting institutional thoughts within.

A way to remedy these issues
- Hybrids with competing institutional logics can systematically selectively couple traits from each logic at an organizational level.
- It allows them to manage incompatibility and reduce risks of alternate practice level stratigies such as de-coupling or compromising.
- Also the origin of the hybrid organization determines how it implements selective copling.
- ex orgs with low legitimacy can through Trojan Horse method enter the field and get higher legitimacy

#### Theory

How hybrids incorporate competing instituional logics

##### Decoupling
In this context, decoupling refers to the ==process by which organizations create a separation between their formal policies or normative structures (the ideals or rules they are supposed to follow) and their actual operational practices (how things are really done in practice).==

In other words, this means that **organizations that conform the the norms and rules of their environment do not implement them at an operational level**.
- Thus creating gaps between symbolically adopted policies and actual organizational behavior

##### Compromising

This is also a viable strategy for orgs facing competing logics

This is where the org manages conflicing demands from different constituents (ex stakeholders, regulatory bodies, community groups) by either conforming to expectationc or compromising staregies to balance the demands and often partially meeting the demands rather than fully addressing them.

Compromising lets orgs atleast partially attend to conflicting demands of different institutional referents, thus avoiding the risk of losing endoresement of the actors who otherwise would be totally ignored rather than partially addressed.

ex. Microfinance company sets interest rates lower than banks but not too low, then they compromise both to the people with little money but also to banks. If they tend to only the banks their legitimacy is questioned by their environment who is their low income customers.

Limitation of this is that it may not allow orgs to fully secure support from important instituoinal referents especially over the long term.

##### Combining Competing Logics
Can be detrimental and company loses on partnerships and collabs and customers if cant adhere to their demands who often are conflicting


#### Discussion part - understanding hybrid organizations

Seems like selectively coupling intact demands imposed by each logic works better than decoupling or compromising.

**Hybrid organizations use selective coupling**
- ==this means the strategic selection of specific practices from a range of competing alternatives==
- decoupling might be that the company says they will do something but do something else instead
    - ==decoupling is about non-implementation== - the org might symbolically conform to something but not operationally

Strength of hybrids is that they have a broader repertoire of instituionalized templated that they can combine in unique ways

**==Trojan horse strategy==**
- Competing commerical logic refers to for profit business that conflicts with social welfare mission of the field ex medicin conflicts in profit vs public good
- The trojan horse means that actors that are inittialy seen as illegitimate or outsiders in a field becuase of their commercial focus can use symbolic and strategic adoption of social behaviors to gain acceptance in the field and in turn “sneak in”, just like trojan horse was a horse because it was national animal of troja.
- Symbolic is orgs outwardly appear to conform to the goal to gain acceptance
- Substansive is orgs way of actually implementing some behaviors and strategies aligned with the fields social goals.
