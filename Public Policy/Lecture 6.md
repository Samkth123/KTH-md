**Ebba Henriksen lecture**

Nonprofit is soicla goals and are organizations

civil society is actions, ideology, volunteering basically - basically the larger sphere of this
- its also a place where you discuss ideologies and values and 

Civil society in public is just disucsesd as something good and volutneering - but its also a place where you dicuss things, and an org can have a goal that you do not agree with but they will still pursue it

Civil society
- An arena, seperate from the state,market, and private shousehold where poeple organise and act together in common interests

Four societal spheres
- each sphere has different logics, and you are different people depending on which sphere you are in
- you will use different logics as you move through these different spheres
- The sectors are in the middle and that is where the orgs are
- This photo is an ideal type, so its a clear cut photo of how eveyrthing is, but in reality its hard to know how some organizations might be in market sector or civil society org ex if a NGO has a daughter company that is for profit where would it be placed? These hybrids are normal

A child dear to many has many names
- nonprofit sector, voluntary sector, third sector, associational life
- popular movement orgs
- the concept of civil society entered the debate in the early 1990s
- In Sweden we have had many movements, which build on each other.
- The concept of civil society entered the debate late 35 years ago

What defines a nonprofit org?
- Non public - not part of public sector & ran by private actors (but can recieve public money)
- Operates in an org form that cannot distribute profits (non distribution constraint)
- No owners, more like members
- Focus on ideas, ideologies and values (but for profit companies also focus on values and market themselves through values they have, but what seperates profits vs nonprofits is that the making of proifts is more important than the values but in NGO values are most important - t채nk p책 lite det man sa om public sector om att the entity existerar bara due to the value of its task, and not the company itself)
- Engages in some form of welfare activity

Why do we need nonprofits?
- Government failure theory
	- basically if state prevents welfare its a standardized solution (in sweden it is high quality, but still standardized and universal)
	- It works well if the people are homogenous and will be happy with standardized solutiun
	- but if its a heterogenous population, we need more nisch solutions, and thats where nonprofits come in
- The trustworthiness principle
	- ex if you go to a restaurant and dont like it, you lost 70 dollars
	- in school its much harder to measure quality, and also its my kid going and not me
	- How do i even know what is high quality in schools
	- The idea is that a nonprofit will be more trustworthy to provide the type of service where ==**information asymmetry**== exist
	- But a for profit might take more money as you will not know if the quality is lowered
- Addressing social gaps?


Governance in nonprofit organizations
- Foundations
- Voluntary associations
	- members select a board
- Economic associations
	- members select a board
- Registered religious communities
	- kind of ilke voluntary associations but need to be religious to register
- (company with limited profit distributions)
	- basically hybrids between market and society
	- maybe can distribute profits but only small profits


2 types of organizational governance 
- normal for profit
- The hourglass construct
	- members placed at top
	- annual meetings in local units (which are many of)
	- They then send representatives to the regional units and general assembly
	- Its a very democratic org where members are at top and decisions goes down to regions then to general assembly
	- then to national board (where have congress every year and vote on big issues and they create )
	- The first triangle is democratic authroity and decision making- indivudla members and elected representatives
	- The second traingle is Non democratic execution, so officals, staff, elected representatives and otehr volunteers
	- Basically send down what Genreal assembly voted on and send it to regional units and local units in turn


Artikeln jag l채ste - Civil society regimes
- Table 3 - Models of third sector regime
- Categorizes civil society into 4 sectors
- Liberal is UK or US where gov dont spend much mone on welfare
- Corporatist is NE or GER where much welfare produced in civil society but the state funding to welfare is high
- Social democratic is Nordic countries, we have little welfare in civil society produced, but we have lots of government spending which is produced in public sector
	- Swedes think we have lots of volunteers and big civil society, and lots of orgs where ovlunteers do much thigns, but we do not have that many employees here
- Statist seciotn is Japan where low  government spending and small nonprofit scale in terms of employees

The swedish civil society regime
- Popular movements organizations engaed in advocacy
	- So ex labor movement & corporatist tradition wher ecivil society gets state inquiry to send feedback on
	- its much about voice and not producing welfare thing
- High level of closeness between closeness between civil society and the state (as they talk much about public policy but not produce much stuff in civil society)
- Small share of welfare production
- membership based, democratic orgs
- low proportion of employees but high volunteer engagement (50% swedes ahve volunteered)
- Large number of organizations (run my volunteers so no professional staff)
- State Church until the year 2000
	- in other countries is relgion big in civil society but not in sweden
	- As saw in article, we see that state took control of church and in turn ate all its responsibilities so welfare is high and dont need to give money to civil society

Why so few nonprofits in welfare
- Sweden has had high religious homogeneity, and the state has opposed religious actors in welfare
	- many civil society orgs abroad are religious
	- State took care of welfare from church
- Difficulties with funding (limited philanthrophy)
	- ex US 30% had given donations to the schools while this would never happen in Sweden
- Previously lacked networks and interest organizations
- No tradition of nonprofit organizations
- Legislation that facors for profit entities
- Challenges in measuring "added value" in public procurement

Differnt types of agreements between the state and nonprofits
- Procurements (LOU)
	- bidding for doing work
- Freedom of choice models (LOV)
	- school system - can open a school and all competition and if u get students u get money from state and if not u get no money
- Nonprofit public partnerships (IOP) (public and nonprift sector collab towards gemmensamt m책l)
	- The partnership should be based on a mutual need for collaboration towards a public benefit goal
	- Both parties should contrinute resources to the operation (might include voluntary efforts)
	- Becomes relevant when procurement regulations do not apply
	- Lacks a legal definition


**CASE**: The swedish hunters association
- Membership org with 159k members anr responsible for wildlife management in Sweden
- 1938 The assoication gets a general assignment from the state to organize parts of the wildlife mangement
- 2021 It was decided thtat the responsibility for wildlife mangement needed to be put out for tender
- There was only one actor who applied to win the procurement and that was the same assoication

Fun fact: salt stones so animals dont go to roads and lick salt during winter


==What are the advantages and disadvantages of procurement rather than the Hunting Association having a continuous assignment? Consider the perspectives of different stakeholders.== Skicka t GPT sen och se

procurement
- markets logic - more incentive to do good as competition
- bad that can change very fast and get new 
- more standardized
- depending on how long the service is might focus more on short term goals rather than long term goals

Continuous assignment
- relationship
- knowledge
- could be more inefficient
- less standardized

For hunters association from their part everything is the same but that they need to waste money on 3 people who need to write procurement bids.

Disadvangegef from state is also that the hunters can ask for more money during the procurement as they are the only ones bidding


Responsibilties of rescue service is firefighting and water resuce (this is scope in this case)
- first profesional fire brigade in 1870s
- more professionalizdd in urban areas
- 671 professionalized fire stations with full and part time employees
- Mix of professional and voluntary stations is 17
- VOluntary fire stations are 120
- Other civil society organizations
- Part time firefighers in smaller areas
- Majority of firestations are professionalized but 120 are voluntary, so they are civil society but they do get trining from the state (so hybrid) and also paid from the state if they extinguish a fire (so civil society but grey area between civil society and state)

But firefighters dont like volunteers and dont want to work with civil society. They talk about civil society which in theory is voluntary failure
- so when civil society orgs are seen as not professional, efficient and not doing a good job

In rural areas it take long time for fire service to reach the fires, so it might be good to have volunteers in place that are trained to take care of such stuff

Also good for bigger fires - so if something big happens like 9/11 need relationship between civil society orgs and public.

Maritime rescue services
- municipalities are responsible for municipal waters (so all rescues that happen here so all biggest 3 lakes and seas)
	- however do not need to rescue people who are drowing at state waters
- The swedish sea rescue society (SSRS) operate on stateowned water
	- so when someone calls SOS the state send out alarm and actor that is closest will go and usually it is SSRS
**CASE**: The Swedish rescue services in cooperation

What might explain the difference between how the two types of rescue services are organized?
- nature of emergencies affect how organized
- fires might spread
- sea is personal emergency

What are the advantages and disadvantages of having civil society organizations run essential services like maritime rescue compared to a professionalized state run service?
- advantages
	- flexibility
	- no bureaucracy constraints
	- costs
	- volunteers as resource 
- disadvantages
	- unprofessional
	- knowledge
	- accountability
	- incentives
	- more resources if run by state

Do you think there are ways for civil society to contribute to everyday operations of rescue services that could help build social capital or should their role be limited to large scale emergencies? Why or why not?
- No
	- Accountability
	- Bj철rntj채nst - more bad than good (people want to do good but sometimes goes bad or lack energy)

Do you  think there are limits to how much responsibility civil society should have in emergency services, and why?
- bj철rntj채nst

==**What makes coppeation between civil society and state possible -->**
**What can we learn from these cases:**==
- Clear mandates and division of responsibilities (ex maritime)
	- municpilaty repsonsible for municipal waters and civil society dont have responsibilty but have mandate of state water and seen as responsible even if responsibility is on state (they have much ownership of the rescue services)
- Combination of self interest and public good
	- ex hunter associate self interest and public good as hunters want game they can hunt but they also want a nice nature and wildlife etc so combine self interest and care of society in the same role when they volunteer so it becomes very powerful that its not either altruism and self interest but combo
	- ex people have boats and like going fast with them, but they also like when they rescue people
- Cooperation between state actors and civil society is important for social capital
	- social capital is important if ex 9/11?
- Civil society as necessary, but undesirable?
	- fireservices - tension in sweden where feel like civil society was before but now state can take over and do better job
- civil society important role in many different areas and a role where for profit would be hard to play that role, but some roles for profit could take over, but civil society is really good for some of because of its members and volunteers etc.
