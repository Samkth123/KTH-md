**Ebba Henriksen lecture**

Nonprofit is soicla goals and are organizations

civil society is actions, ideology, volunteering basically - basically the larger sphere of this
- its also a place where you discuss ideologies and values and 

Civil society in public is just disucsesd as something good and volutneering - but its also a place where you dicuss things, and an org can have a goal that you do not agree with but they will still pursue it

Civil society
- An arena, seperate from the state,market, and private shousehold where poeple organise and act together in common interests

Four societal spheres
- each sphere has different logics, and you are different people depending on which sphere you are in
- you will use different logics as you move through these different spheres
- The sectors are in the middle and that is where the orgs are
- This photo is an ideal type, so its a clear cut photo of how eveyrthing is, but in reality its hard to know how some organizations might be in market sector or civil society org ex if a NGO has a daughter company that is for profit where would it be placed? These hybrids are normal

A child dear to many has many names
- nonprofit sector, voluntary sector, third sector, associational life
- popular movement orgs
- the concept of civil society entered the debate in the early 1990s
- In Sweden we have had many movements, which build on each other.
- The concept of civil society entered the debate late 35 years ago

What defines a nonprofit org?
- Non public - not part of public sector & ran by private actors (but can recieve public money)
- Operates in an org form that cannot distribute profits (non distribution constraint)
- No owners, more like members
- Focus on ideas, ideologies and values (but for profit companies also focus on values and market themselves through values they have, but what seperates profits vs nonprofits is that the making of proifts is more important than the values but in NGO values are most important - tänk på lite det man sa om public sector om att the entity existerar bara due to the value of its task, and not the company itself)
- Engages in some form of welfare activity

Why do we need nonprofits?
- Government failure theory
	- basically if state prevents welfare its a standardized solution (in sweden it is high quality, but still standardized and universal)
	- It works well if the people are homogenous and will be happy with standardized solutiun
	- but if its a heterogenous population, we need more nisch solutions, and thats where nonprofits come in
- The trustworthiness principle
	- ex if you go to a restaurant and dont like it, you lost 70 dollars
	- in school its much harder to measure quality, and also its my kid going and not me
	- How do i even know what is high quality in schools
	- The idea is that a nonprofit will be more trustworthy to provide the type of service where ==**information asymmetry**== exist
	- But a for profit might take more money as you will not know if the quality is lowered
- Addressing social gaps?


Governance in nonprofit organizations
- Foundations
- Voluntary associations
	- members select a board
- Economic associations
	- members select a board
- Registered religious communities
	- kind of ilke voluntary associations but need to be religious to register
- (company with limited profit distributions)
	- basically hybrids between market and society
	- maybe can distribute profits but only small profits
