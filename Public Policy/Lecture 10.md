smart homes
- about individuals private homes
- elederly with multiple sickness - average age for admitted to elderly home is very high typ ish 85-90
- most people stay in their home till they are very old
- problem is taht there is a grey scale ex u are young and riding a bike, the kid can build up capacitiy. but in older age dont have that capacity and its going down. While that capcity is going down, you will be needed some help. 
- Big potential cost saver to let people continue to live and work because you will pay lots of teaxes
