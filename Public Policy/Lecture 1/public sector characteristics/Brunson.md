**Politicization and company-ization - institutional affiliation and confusion in the organizational world**

Many companies are both politicized and institutionalized. This leads to institutional confusion as they try to imitate different aspects of these two parts.

A formal organization has specific goals in mind and laid out rules and a hierarchy. Informal organization is a social structure that arises when people with common interests meet

  

3 organizational sub institutions

- political organization

- state and municipal are based on this

- company

- for organizing trade and production of goods

- association

- trade union and special interest groups

  

The Brunson article argues that organizations are generally constructed in a way that combines elements from more than one institution

- creating institutional confusion

#### The political organization and the company - what they are individually
##### Organizational environment

  

The Political organization & the company are dependent on their environments, and need legitimacy ie they need to be tolerated by their environments - but these are different between the 2.

The political organization is dependent its environment in the form of citizens, who provide legitimacy. The citizen is characterized by interests and demands, and all their demands are legitimate. The organization looks to get support of citizen in democratic votes.
  

In the environment of the companys most crucial actor is the customer. Customers have more specific demands than citizens, but the company can unlike the political organization choose to only serve some of the customers demand and only some specific customers. This is competition. This is threathened bu monopoly. The company choose who they sell to and the customer choose who they buy from. Management does not generate resources for the company and the customer is not intereted in that, but only in the products (är detta längre sant tho? tänker på corporate responsibility å så —> fel, detta är att man tar delar av olika organisationer nu förtiden).


**The political organization exists for its surroundings and not itself. It has no intristic value if its task dissapears.**


The company has no **mission in that sense**. It should only generate demand for its product, and if demand falls, it needs to be flexible and adapt stratgies, showing no loyalty to old idas. Survival is the companies value and goal.

  
##### Financing

The company claims legitimacy by producing useful goods that are in demand in a competitve environment. The political organization claims that its services are useful to everyone and that its under democratic control.

These claims are fundamental in getting resources from the outside.

The political organization gets funds from taxes, and is given to a central unit in the organisation which later redistributes it to each unit. Here is a problem of how much each unit gets, and we introduce budgets.

The company does not need budgets as a necessity, as each unit should be responsible for its own result.

Financing in company from external capital comes from how well a company can argue that they are doing (ex investments/loans). Vice versa in political org financing comes from bad results, and saying that they need more budget as money is not enough (say to citizen how bad things are going now and how bad they will be in the future, to in turn get more money from them). This makes the budgeting a powerful demonstration of poor performance. Budgeting therefore is not a good instrument of top down control, as it increases money for departments in the org rather than going for efficiency.

##### Organizational forms - action or conflict?  

In the company, the goal is unity and striving for the same goal.

Political organisation is different, as its crucial competence lies in reflecting citizens conflicting ideas.

Decision processes that mobilize action do not reflect inconsistent demands very well and vice versa. Rational decision-making where you formulate problems, specifiy goals and consider alternatives and do pros/cons list is good for conflicting ideologies. To the political organisation rational decision making is attractive, while the company wants to focus more on action.

**Hypocracy** is produced in organisations where talk is done in accordance of one set of norms, but decisions in accordance with another, and act according to a third. This easily arises in the political organization, where it is difficult to implement decisions due to continuous conflict.
##### Generalization and change

Companies aim to specialize and concentrate on a particular type of action - a natural way forward. Policital organisations want to generalize as the ideas of the public increasingly diverge and touch on new areas. **==Generalization==** also promotes legitimacy as the political org listens to its environment.

##### Leadership and control - results or procedures

Citizens care **not only on what** political organisations achieve but also **how they do it.** The text also says that mangement is not concerned with sales and the result of the company?

#### Politicization, company-ization and associationization

ex assoicatiozation is IKEA family member
Companyzation is political or starting to see people as customers or want more autonomy
politiztaion is companies taking on social role. Ex HPE providing läxhjälp
##### Politicization

Individual organisations that characteristics of the political organisations. For examples its not enough for large companies to sell products and generate profit, but to maintain legimity they need to show that their values are decent/just/rational and that they somehow are part of making society better. When a company relates itself to civic duty it gets new importance, and it becomes important not only what it produces but also how.

  

##### Company-ization

This means that an organization that originally had a strong political element starts assuming features from company insitutions. For example, a state or local government authority begins regarding people as customers. Ex increasing size of fees for the authorities services.

  
Another form of companyization is when an authority demands more **autonomy**. It is also involved when the political instiution seems to be getting a **value of its own** and not related to the **task at hand**.
##### Associationization

Organisations can adopt characteristics of associations. Examples are acquiring members, such as IKEA family club. Members are more attractive than customers as they are more loyal.


#### Processes of institutional confusion

  

Several kinds of processes driven by different causes may lead to institutional confusion.

  

##### Picking out individual bits

Actors might pick out specific bits of different institutions and add to their own, and not worry if it looks inconsistent to what other features of the organisation. The chance of this is higher if the imitator sees the organisation they imitate from to be like their own, or if they see no difference in different organisations

If **==activities in the organisation are decoupled==** this potential inconsistency of imported features might not necessarily be problematic.

Both company and political organisation have attractive and unattractive features. The unattractive features of a organisation look for the attractive ones of the other model. A highly political organisation might be attrated by management techniques that focus on results and action. A company may be attracted by methods for dealing with conflicts and insoluble problems.

The picking out of individual bits are **somewhat opportunistic**. Managers may exploit parts of an instituion that suit themselves and refrain for the aspects that dont. Public authorities want more autonomy and rather have customers than citizens, but do not want competition that comes with company institution. Company management want to avoid competition, but not allow civic influence.

  

##### Realizing institutions

Ex Previosuly Swedish Railways had financing problems, but was then split into two parts. One was clearly ersembling a company with task of running the trains, while the other was a state authority who was tasked with maintaining and building tracks.  

The financing strategy of the political organization appeared to make it function less effectively as it had poor results and continuously needed more funds. But in reality it is attractive to take the company insitutional form, as money has different meanings in company and political org. In company, money is created and company can generate profit, being proud of it. In political organisation, its the reverse, as it consumption of money from the public is regarded as **==consuming==** others money and seen in negative light. The greater the consumption, the worse it is. If the political organisation shows a surplus of money, its seen as **==over taxation==** rather than something the organization has created itself. All this means that political orgnization may be regarded as **draining** while company is seen as **sustaining**.

  

##### Adaption

Institutional confusion may arise because organizations adapt to changes in their environments or changes in their own behaviour that challengetheir institutional affiliation.

Inconsistent demands on companies ex politicization in the form of having to be good for society can leed to hypocrisy.
