INSIDE THE HYBRID ORGANIZATION: SELECTIVE COUPLING AS A RESPONSE TO
COMPETING INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS

**Hybrid organisations** incorporate elements from different institutional logics, hybrids are by nature arenas of contradiction. Ex social enterprises have social mission goal but caught between competing demands of market logic and social welfare logic - should they incorpoarte for profit or not for profite entities? Distribute profit to owners or reinvest in social mission? Use paid professionals prioritizing efficiency or have voluteers?

Just as social enterprises need to address these dilemmas to operate, all hybrids need to find ways to deal with the multiple demands to which they are exposed to


**Selective coupling** is a strategy used by hybrid organizations to manage competing institutional logics. Here's a breakdown of the concept:

**Selective coupling** is a way for hybrid organizations to handle different sets of rules or expectations (called institutional logics) that can sometimes conflict with each other. Here’s a simpler breakdown:
**What is Selective Coupling?**

**Basic Idea**: Instead of choosing one set of rules over another or trying to mix them together in a way that loses their original meaning, selective coupling means taking specific parts from each set of rules and using them as they are.

**Why Use It?:** This approach helps organizations show that they are legitimate and credible to different groups of people without pretending to be something they’re not.

Contrast with other strategies:
Unlike decoupling (symbolically adopting one logic while practicing another)
Unlike compromising (finding a middle ground between logics)

The paper reveals that organizations entering the field with low legitimacy (e.g., those with a commercial background entering the social sector) tend to adopt more elements from the dominant logic of the field they're entering. This is referred to as the "Trojan horse" pattern.

Selective coupling allows hybrid organizations to manage the inherent contradictions between competing logics more effectively than previously theorized strategies.


**Decoupling** has traditionally referred to the process through which organizations separate their normative or prescriptive structures from their operational structures. In other terms, it refers to instances in which "organizations conform closely to the meanings and categories ritually defined by the environment, but do not attempt seriously to implement them at the operational level" (Scott, 2003: 279). Organizations thus create and maintain gaps between symbolically adopted policies and actual organizational behavior

## Decoupling vs. Selective Coupling

- **Decoupling**:
    - Organizations symbolically adopt practices from one logic while actually implementing practices from another logic.
    - It involves creating a gap between what an organization says it does and what it actually does.
    - This can be seen as hypocritical if discovered, as the organization is essentially pretending to follow certain rules or practices.
    
- **Selective Coupling**:
    - Organizations choose and implement specific elements from multiple competing logics.
    - They genuinely adopt and integrate these selected elements into their operations.
    - This approach allows organizations to satisfy different stakeholders without being deceptive.
