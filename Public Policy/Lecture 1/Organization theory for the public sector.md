### Part 1: Organization Theory in the Public Sector
This section discusses the need for a distinct organization theory tailored for the public sector, emphasizing the importance of understanding various organizational forms and their evolution in response to public policy. It outlines three key perspectives for analysis:

Instrumental Perspective: Focuses on political control and rational decision-making.
Cultural Perspective: Highlights the influence of established norms and traditions on behavior.
Myth Perspective: Examines how organizations adapt to prevailing beliefs and values.

### Part 2: Decision-Making in Public Organizations
This part addresses two types of decision-making within public organizations: external decisions affecting citizens and internal decisions regarding organizational structure. It emphasizes the complexity of public decision-making processes and the importance of analyzing how organizational frameworks impact these decisions. The need for a nuanced understanding of formal and informal norms is highlighted, with an emphasis on the interplay between organizational structure, culture, and myths.

### Part 3: Bounded Rationality and Political Organization
Here, the concept of bounded rationality is introduced, arguing that decision-makers operate under constraints of limited knowledge and resources. The section critiques the traditional view of public organizations as merely hierarchical and emphasizes their role as political actors. It advocates for an analysis that recognizes the external political environment's influence and challenges the dominance of economic models in evaluating public sector performance.

### Part 4: Conclusion and Future Directions
The final part outlines the book's matrix structure, which will explore key aspects of public organizations—such as goals, leadership, and reform—through the lens of the three perspectives. It proposes a transformative approach that integrates elements from all perspectives, stressing the need for a deeper understanding of public organizations as dynamic entities capable of influencing and adapting to societal changes. The focus will also be on normative goals, emphasizing the public sector’s role in enhancing democratic governance and citizen welfare.
