### Business model innovation in the public sector: an integrative framework

Framework for how public sector entities such innovate their business models

Difference between how public and private business models is that in public business models an analogy is that public framework should be a community garden where things that everyone likes is produced

Building blocks are same, but goals are different
- public wants to define value in a much more broad societal way
- busted myth that public entities dont have business models
- external environments super important for public orgs
    - budget limitations
    - power dynamics
    - citizens new and changing thoughts
    - ex libraries today very differnet to before
        - people expect other stuff from libraries otday
        - ignoring these demands from their environments makes the public entity obsolete
        - Need to stay proactive not reactive

Public value paradox
- sometimes whats good for an individual is not good for the entire community
- ex AC on hot day good for me but bad for community as a whole pga environemtn effects
- Paradox of self interest vs public interest
    - tight rope walk that public orgs face
    - ex public transport
        - some people prefer to drive own car even if its more polution for all
        - but robust transport system is good for community as whole
        - need to find mellanting
    - if public orgs can nail the balance leads to something amazing
    - Public orgs create value but how do they capture it? private companies capture value through profits.
        - public catches it in terms of “legitimacy”
        - the more public value they deliver, they get more legitimacy and prove their worth, which leads to them being able to drive even more public value as they are now trusted
- How is legitimacy linked to innovation?
    - business model innovation increases legitimacy if done right
    - imagine city planning new park. Instead of designing it in house, could involve citizens
        - reflects more what community wants
        - foster ownership in project and in extension city government

7 step model for public org innovation
- analyze situation and see what stakeholders need
- ideate & brainstorm solutions
- feasibility - are the great ideas possible both physically and legally
- feedback and iterate idea
- which solution is best - accountable process to maintain legitimacy
- implement
- reassess

#### Practical challenges and implications of public sector innovation

 Stakeholder power imbalance
- citizens dont have option to take business elsewhere if odnt like how public service is being done
- you can boycott company u dont like, but you cant stop paying taxes or change governemtn just like that
- so there is a large power imbalance
- How do public orgs adress the imbalance when innovating business models
    - The key to lowering the imbalance is radical transparency and accountability throughtout process
    - actively tty to get feedback from many groups of soceity
    - integrate it and make sure everybody has their voices heard
- Ex how technology can be double edged sword in power imbalance
    - ex good to have social places where everyone can talk
    - but not everyone has access to it or knowledge of using it
    - ex app for reporting potholes
        - only rich and knowledgeable will use it more
        - because seniors and poor people will not be able report
        - This awareness of power dynamics in society is very important as well

So above is awareness of power dynamics

Another challenge is navigating public value paradox
- whats good for me might not be good for everyone dilemma
- Whos needs should take the driver seat when resources are limited
- and how do you even measure public value in a meaningful way? ex cant look at spreadsheet
- public value is often intangible and multifaceted as it includes:
    - social equity
    - environmental sustainability
    - citizen satisfaction
    - trust in government
- so not just matter of crunching models
- Hard to design business models that everyone aligns on
    - need ongoing dialogue
    - neogitaiton and compromise between different stakeholders
    - continuous process of adaptation and refinement (också väldigt viktigt i procurement innovation) instead of one size fits all solution
    - It is very close to collaborative and iterative appraoch rather than beureucratic top down business model
    - engage citizens in design of new models
        - gives ownership and trust in process as well
        - fostering sense of collective responibility for solving public problems

One more challenge: Has to do with pase of change in external environment
Important for public orgs to scan horizon of new trends and techs
Problem is that traditional beuricratic process are slow to adapting to this as its risk averse
- public orgs often have many legal constraints and regulations
Key is to foster culture of innovation and experimentation in org
- take calculated risks and not be afraid to fail
- public orgs need to become more comfortable with failing forward (companyzation in a way) and learning from mistakes and iterating quickly
- also rethink classic performance metrics that focuses on cost cutting or profit, but rather looking at innovation and impact
- because taking risk can lead to breakthroughs even if it does not immediately save money
- need to find a way to measure and reward creation of public value even if it does not fit neatly into classic modules (hmm vad tycker jag om detta?)

Lastly:
Legitimacy trap
- happens when public orgs become so fixated on mainting existing level of public trust that they become overly cautious that they become resistent to change
- they are afriad of making a mistake so they do not innovate or anything
- fatal in  environemtn that is always developing
- tight rope walk tbh because legitimacy is hard earned and easily lost, but you become obsolete if you do not continue to innovate and follow trends
- need to strike balance between preserving legitimacy and innovating with risk
- its essential for long term development for public orgs

#### Takeaways

What stands out?
- tells public sector to become agile and innovative
- public orgs need to become more citizen centric, take risks and learn from failures and invovle citiens as partners in services rather than seeing them as passive recievers of services
- 7 step roadmap is good
