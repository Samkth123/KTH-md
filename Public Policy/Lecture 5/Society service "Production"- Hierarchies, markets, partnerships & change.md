Basic recapitulation
- Public sector multiplicity
- Institutional logics - Different basic logics (norms, conceptions, rules) of our three societal sectors (**==tradeoffs==** - ex efficiency is harder for public sector as if we have pharmcy in north which is not gonig well we cant close it because we need to have it there for the customers, but if it were a private company they would just close it)
	- Public sector
		- equal treatment
		- legal security
	- Business firms
		- efficiency
		- profitability
	- nonprofit sector
		- altruism
		- democracy
- What do we mean with an **idealtype**?
	- Not a normative concept
	- Means that we have a simplified model with the basic fundaments.
	- Used by scholars bevause facilitates discussions
	- In practice we have many mixes of the institutional logics, obv have business with altruistic things as well as public sectors who are very efficicent parts
	- Ex. hybdrid organisation where you use both public and private sector throughts
		- ex Svea skog - one side uphold natural reservation and so on, but also have demands on profitability. This is a hybdrid organsaion



#### How do we order the provision of welfare services - hierarchies, markets, partnersihips and change

Outsourcing trend in private sector

Public sector has new public management 
- **==marketization==- public sector doesnt produce the service itself but buy it instead**
- backsourcing in berlin et al is backlash to this

Normally talk about hierarchy and market, but seldom consider partnership part in alternativ way to order welfare service production
- 2 partnerships
- ppp
- ppm

#### Provision or production, users or costuomer? - ==the power of labels== - basically what are we in regards to public services

==Labels affect how we:==
- talk about practice
- what models we may use or not
- what is considered right/good or the opposite
- often sensitive question in the nonprofit sector and the public sector
    - ex in red cross its weird to talk about production and customers, 
    - its not really in their identity.

**==marketization==** - public giving out to private to run stuff

#### Market problems/failures and market reorganisations

Marketization of snow maintenance in Stockholm Municipality
- 1993 from inhouse to buyer/seller separation. SEAB and a belief in automatic competition
- But hardly any competition. SEAB close to monopoly
- Percieved market failure. High market concentration (Very gew sellers and tenders)

Organizational attempts to increase the number of suppilers and tenders
- divide the contracts (smaller and more contracts)
- longer contracts
- simplify the contracts

The attemps did not bring the desired results

2000 politicians decided to sell SEAB to the construction company PEAB

SEAB has close to monopoly, this affects costs and quality for street maintenance

Had free market, then changed towards increased control (more rules, moinitoring, sanctiosn)
- ==**innovation**==:
    - technologies of control - GPS & GIS to track the trucks
    - sellers not happy of the transparancy need

Takeaways from snow case:
- One generic similarity between markets and organizations - they are both organized
- Market challenges: Market concentration high. Quality ptoeblems (below contracts), control problems (difficult, expensive) â€”> Berlin et al article
- Market re organizations - never ending story
    - a case of the often comple perpetual work of organizing and re organizing markets
- Shifting market forms over time
    - from attempts to increase supply side multiplicity to significantly increased control, by the use of more organization and new technologies
- Adhocracy to pure burecracy to unorthodox bureacract? 
    - Basically adhocracy so more free but then had to go back to changing rules back again
    - They then left that idea and went back to centralizing production where they went from several buyers to one buyer, and went to increase control as innovation. Still beuracractic but a step away from classical market model

#### Partnerships/networks
Partnerships 

###### Public.private partnership ppp
what is pp
- pooling of resources
- collaboration

2 examples in sweden that did not turn out well
- nya karolinska (region sthlm and skanska)
- Arlandabanan (the state and A-train)

==PP ==
- demands a lot of resources and knowledge of both parts to get right/reasonable
- complicated contract work
- risks of being lockedup in unfavorable longterm agreeemnts if not highly competent part
- so if negotiating in a much more experienced party than you you might be going into a bad deal longterm

Challenges
- high ==**transcational costs**== (cost of collecting info, analysing ingo, writing contracts, osv. If you loose a contract in sweden you usually appeal to court because lots of cost in buying/selling)
- lack of appropriate skills
- incomplete risk transfer (may construct contract where the parties dont take equal shares of responsibility)
- higher end user charges

Critical succes factors:
- Appropriate risk charing
- Strong private consortium (the partner must be strong so you know that they will be there, have competence, and have muscle to go through changes in economy)
	- but here problem as startips left outside unlike usa 5% must go to startups sthlm stad spoke this
- political and public support
- transparent procurement

##### Public nonprofit partnership pnp

what is pnp (IOP in swedish)
- pooling of resources
- collaboration
- no profit aspect involed as opposed to ppp

Trend of more pnps in sweden
- elderly care, migration/integration, youth activities (sport, culture etc), women aid centres

example: womens aid centre
- a civil society developed service
- helping maltreated/assaulted women
- general demand for marketizations in Sweden ie by the competition agency
    - they dont like this public nonprofit partnerships - want either market or organizations
- thretens many civil society organizations (transaction costs, survival, the value of altruism does not come through)
    - they are questioned by competition agency authority legal struggle
- alternatives to marketizations and public procurement?

Strategies in the handling of public procurement - 3 municpalities
- 2 municaplitices sigtuna and botkyrka
    - strategy: Reject and Replace Public Procurement with public nonprofit partnerships (PNP)
    - Municipality and civil society womens aid organization pool different resources and cooperate more closely
    - both municipality and nonprofit organization content with the ollaboration (quality/price)
    - collaboration quite close
- 1 municipality Nacka
    - Strategy: Accept and Adapt (argue for relevant public procurement quality factors)
    - Concern for their women aid centre survival

Quotes:
- public procurement law if we comply we cant handle adminsitration because we are too small and we need to merge women aids serbices in sthlm county and become like a company (lack of administrative scale=
- 20 pages tickoff vs small person in how woman needs help, recognition and competence in how people percieve violence, i dont think thats in public procurement docuemnts (lack of important quality factors)
    - basically public procurement doesn ot refelct quality needed in these services

Cricital succes factors for PNPs
- Capabilities and competence of the inboled organizations (drives public sector professionalism - cant just have volunteers but need to have employees)
- Contract inventrives to improve quality/efficiency factors
- Measurements that match contract
- Shared vision of collaboration and joint innovation
- engagement of local context clients

##### Change
Backsourcing is an example of change in Berlin article
- Berlin article is about change



Reasons for backsourcing:

Many similar problems with markets/outsourcing for public organizations and business firms, leading to backsourcing. But also difference
- Similar resons, public and business:
    - loss of control
    - lack of quality
    - information asymmetries

- DIfferent reasons, public and business:
    - changed technology B
    - Increased costs B
    - Contractual problems P

Concluding remarks fon the framework for welfare production
- common with ==naive views== (by decisionamkers) of what we have not experiences for example of alternative forms for ordering welfare provision/production
    - ex snowthing thoguht would automatically create competition but failed
- Each form has its challenges/critical factors - as do change between them
- each form can potentially be orgnaized in a huge variety of ways 
- we (professor) can help you develop a toolbox of concepts, models and theories, but you always need to be situational (understanding the prerequisities in the specific case) and think for yourself (application, choices)
- Room for innovation in welfare production governance forms?
