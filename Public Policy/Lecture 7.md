Pattent is innovation
- depends on if it could be expected from someone from the industry

Bottomline of different sectors

What is an innovation?
- we only see innovations when it directly affects us and we see it ex LLM
- If its internal innovation we dont see? Is it still innovation
- Joseph Schumpeter
    - wrote definitions of 5 things he thinks are characteristics of innovation
        - novelty
        - usefullness
        - new product/service
        - new way of delivering it ex dont need to call to get doctor appointment we can just use app and book

Different types of public innovations
- Could we put solar panels on all places?

Public offials dont necessarily want to save money or lower taxes, so why would they want innovation?

Driver of public innovations?
- kry
- 1177 region sthlm

fun fact: 1/10 money to swedbank goes to compliance

==layers of regulations exist==
- does this make innovation easier or harder?
- easier as more things to innovate
- if trust eachother need less regulations ex in banking system

why dont innovation happen more often
- lack of knowledge on how to innovatte
    - if you dont know how to do the solution you need to procure it
    - lack of knoweldge of what problem is and what soultions is and how you can connect them
- internal problems ex staff/mangement, trade unions, organisational structure, logistics and turf battles
    - budgets in differnet places, and one guy needs to say yes but who gets the benefit is someone else
    - especially if its national, regional and local then more problems in who gets what
- Fear of negative publicity and/or public doubts about the effectiveness of innovative programmes
    - we wont have incentives to innovative if the benefit goes to people but all bad things that happen to us if something goes wrong
    - if in private you find a way to monetize somethuing or save money you will go up in career
    - but if its in public you do not know who will specificaly benefit
- Difficultty in reaching the target group
    - ex vaccines to those who need are vaccinated less
    - but if its in private and you come with a solution that is free or good they have more incentive to give it out
- Opposition from those affected in the business sector

staffing/hr/leadership, structure/culture/incentives, governance operations, competition legitimacy
