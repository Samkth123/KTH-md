Neither Marker Nor Hierarchy
Network forms of organization

Market:
* A market is a decentralized, voluntary exchange system where buyers and sellers come together to negotiate terms of trade.
* In markets, transactions are typically one-off, short-term, and don't require significant long-term commitments or investments from either party.
* Key feature: In a market, contracts are usually simple and cover basic exchange terms. The relationship between the parties is transactional—once the transaction is complete, the parties are free to move on to other transactions with different parties.

Hierarchy:
* A hierarchy, on the other hand, refers to a more centralized organizational structure, such as a firm or a company, where decision-making authority is concentrated at the top, and there is a system of command and control over employees or subordinates.
* In a hierarchy, there is a longer-term relationship and ongoing collaboration. These are organized within a firm, where various tasks are coordinated and managed internally.
* Key feature: A hierarchy reduces the need for negotiation and re-negotiation by establishing clear rules and authority structures. Authority helps manage uncertainty and opportunism (people trying to take advantage of others) by creating standard operating procedures and internal policies.


#### Markets and firms

Williamsons arguemnts is that transactions that involve uncertainty about their outcome, that recur frequently and require substantial “**transaction specific investments**” of money/energy/time & cant be easily transfered are likely to take place within hierarichically organized firms.
- Exchanges that are straightforward, non-repetitive & require no transaction specific investment take place across a market interface

Transactions are moved from markets into hierarchies after knowledge specific to transaction build up due to
- Bounded rationality - the inability of actors to write contracts to cover everything but if its in a firm its covered by its governance
- Opportunism - people take advantage of the idea and steal it maybe, which is mititgated by authority relations and by stronger identifications parties get when joined under a common roof

However both the view of markets and heirarchies are old and can be woven into eachother, as a market is not just a continuum.
 People argue different things about the market, for example that it is not an entity in itself but a cultural and social construction. Others say that markets cannot be insulated from social structures because the different social aspects result in information assymetries and give specific parties benefits and others disadvantages.

Other skeptics speak of the incorporation of hierarchy dynamics in markets, as some markets are dominated and replaced by interorganizational collaborations, and that lots of economic activity in markets depends on long term relationships and not the one time transactional thing spoken about earlier.

#### Markets, hierarchies and networks
Econmic exchance is embeedded in a particular social structural context. Some forms of exchance are more social (more dependent on relationships, mutual interests and reputation - and less guided by formal structure of authrity)

The philosphy that undergirds exchange also contrasts across these forms. In markets you drive the hardest possible bargain for immediate exchange. In networks the focus is on creating inbedtedness and reliance oner the long haul. A prosperous market trader would be viewed as petty and untrustworthy in networks, while the network people would be seen as naive and foolish in the market

markets offer choice flecibility and opportunity, and are good for fast and simple communication. No one need to rely on someones else for direction, and only prices determine production and exchange.

in hierarchy or organization boundaries expand to internalize transcations and resource flows that previously were conducted in a marketplace. Hierarical structures have formal decision making processes, reporting mechanism and clean lines of authroity. The strength in them is its reliability and capacity for producing large number of goods or services. When hierarichical forms are conrfronted by sharp fluctuations in demand and unatinicpated changes, their liabilities are exposed.

Networks are lighter on their feet then hierarchies. In network modes of resource allocation, transactions occur neither through discrete exchanges nor by administrative fiat but through networks of individuals engaged in reciprocal, preferential, mutually supportive actions. They do not have the explicit criteria of the market nor the hierarchy structure. In networks the network relationship is that one party is dependent on resources controlled by the other, and that there are gains to be had by pooling resources. They pursue their own interest at expense of others and thats the agreement they have.

In network forms of resource allocaiton, individual units exist not by themselves but in relation to other units (basically precis som public entity exists just to fulfull its goal, och some att vissa avdelning på HPE är riktade mot Ericsson procurement).

Networks are good for when need of efficient reliable information is wanted, as useful info rarely flow the the formal chain of command in an organization, or can be given from shifting price signals like in the market. Rather it is obtained by someone you have dealt with in the past and found reliable. Information in the network is “thicker” than that or the market and “more free” than that of the hierarchy. Networks are good for exchange of commodities which value is hard to put a price on, ex know-how, tech capability and particular approach or style of production. Reciprocity is normal in networks - return ill for ill and good for good. This is long term perspective

Networks cant be only seen as collaboration and concord. Instead, each point of contact in a network can be a source of conflict. Also have aspects of dependency, and repeats of this creates patterns and keep newcomers outside. They basically dictate who competes with who if a large company decided to take in or not take in subcontractors.
