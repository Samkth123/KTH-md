It’s time to dispel the myth that innovation must be disruptive. Nondisruptive creation is an alternative path to growth.

Disruption occurs when an innovation creates a new market and business model that cause established players to fall.

Not surprisingly, many have come to view disruption as a synonym for innovation.


A single-minded focus on disruption leads companies to overlook another building block of innovation and growth — one that we would argue is more important.
- That other building block is what we call nondisruptive creation, which offers a new way of thinking about what’s possible.
- It highlights the immense potential for creating new markets where none existed before. 
- This is creation without disruption or destruction. 
- All the demand generated by this kind of innovation is new.

Nondisruptive creation is just as much a modern phenomenon. Microfinance, Viagra, life coaching, Post-it notes, health clubs, and environmental consulting are all prime examples, as are, more recently, online dating, crowdfunding, and smartphone accessories. In each case, the pie was expanded without destroying existing businesses or markets.


Disruption unlocks growth and creates compelling value for end users, but at painful adjustment costs for societies. It imposes a trade-off. Shuttered companies, lost jobs, and hurt communities are inherent by-products, as market creation and market destruction are inextricably linked

Part of nondisruptive creation’s appeal is that it breaks this trade-off. It increases the economic pie with minimal to no social pain. It’s a positivesum approach to innovation, as opposed to the zero-sum nature of disruption.


Most companies today focus their efforts on what it would take to disrupt existing markets. 
- This narrows their vision and blinds them to the wealth of nondisruptive, market-creating innovations they could unlock. 
- For established companies and startups alike, a nondisruptive approach creates several distinctive advantages:
	- Making execution emotionally and politically easier
		- Disruption will kill your own industry if you are an established company there
		- ex Kodak created the first digital camera but tried to withstand distruption so konkurs
		- Management can put undue overhead or starve the disruptive sector of resources to not risk their jobs
		- Nondisruptive innovation is more non threatening
	- Offering a good counterresponse to disruption.
		- Nondisruptive creation can be an effective way to respond to market disruptors.
		- Ex when planes became a thing, sea travel could not match price and speed
		- The company that had sea travel instead started offering luxury cruises to public
			- Cunard opened up the entire cruise tourism industry.
	- Avoiding Goliath
		- When companies — especially startups — set out to disrupt an existing market, they often face well-entrenched market leaders with far greater financial and marketing resources.
	- Reducing conflicts with social interest groups and government agencies
		- When the social costs incurred by disruption become too great, social interest groups and government agencies often lobby against, clamp down on, rein in, or tax the disruptor. 
		- Consider how city after city has attempted to impose regulations and penalties to stymie Uber’s ability to maneuver and expand
		- Since nondisruptive creation doesn’t displace existing businesses and livelihoods, it imposes minimal adjustment costs on society and allows companies to largely avoid these negative issues.

### An expanded view of innovation and growth

We need a model that recognizes and embraces both disruptive and nondisruptive creation, since they are complementary engines of growth. 

Focusing on only one leads to a biased view of what’s possible and limits a company’s potential to create the markets of tomorrow.

Which innovation strategies drive disruption, and which drive nondisruptive creation? 
- The answer comes down to the type of issue a company sets out to address as it launches its innovation strategies.

There are three basic ways to pursue innovation. Companies can: 
- Offer a breakthrough solution to an industry’s existing problem. 
- Identify and solve a brand-new problem or seize a brand-new opportunity. • Redefine an existing industry problem and solve the redefined problem. Let’s look at how each approach strikes a different balance between disruptive and nondisruptive creation
