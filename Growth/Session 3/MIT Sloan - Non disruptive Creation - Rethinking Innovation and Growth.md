It’s time to dispel the myth that innovation must be disruptive. Nondisruptive creation is an alternative path to growth.

Disruption occurs when an innovation creates a new market and business model that cause established players to fall.

Not surprisingly, many have come to view disruption as a synonym for innovation.


A single-minded focus on disruption leads companies to overlook another building block of innovation and growth — one that we would argue is more important.
- That other building block is what we call nondisruptive creation, which offers a new way of thinking about what’s possible.
- It highlights the immense potential for creating new markets where none existed before. 
- This is creation without disruption or destruction. 
- All the demand generated by this kind of innovation is new.

Nondisruptive creation is just as much a modern phenomenon. Microfinance, Viagra, life coaching, Post-it notes, health clubs, and environmental consulting are all prime examples, as are, more recently, online dating, crowdfunding, and smartphone accessories. In each case, the pie was expanded without destroying existing businesses or markets.
