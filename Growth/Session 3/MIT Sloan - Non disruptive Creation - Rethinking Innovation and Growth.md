It’s time to dispel the myth that innovation must be disruptive. Nondisruptive creation is an alternative path to growth.

Disruption occurs when an innovation creates a new market and business model that cause established players to fall.

Not surprisingly, many have come to view disruption as a synonym for innovation.


A single-minded focus on disruption leads companies to overlook another building block of innovation and growth — one that we would argue is more important.
- That other building block is what we call nondisruptive creation, which offers a new way of thinking about what’s possible.
- It highlights the immense potential for creating new markets where none existed before. 
- This is creation without disruption or destruction. 
- All the demand generated by this kind of innovation is new.
