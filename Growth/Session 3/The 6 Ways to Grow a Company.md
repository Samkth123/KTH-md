Summary:
The first step to generating real growth is to understand where it comes from. 
It can be boiled down to six simple categories: 
- **new processes**, 
	- **Sell the same stuff at higher margins**: Cut production and delivery costs, automate for efficiencies, cut fat in the supply chain or manufacturing, and utilize robots.
- **new experiences**, 
	- **Sell more of the same stuff to the same people**: Increase retention and share by powerfully connecting with customers. An example is the Apple Store experience, which many would argue is as compelling as the company’s products.
- **new features**, 
	- **Sell enhanced stuff to the same people**: Add improvements that drive incremental purchases. An example of this / is every new phone Apple releases, with better cameras and so on.
- **new customers**, 
	- **Sell more of the same stuff to new people**: Introduce the product to new markets with needs similar to your core, or to markets where it might address a different need. For Apple, this goes back to reaching the mainstream rather than the design community
- **new offerings**, 
	- **Make new stuff to sell:** Develop a new product — not just enhancements. Find new needs to solve within existing markets, or invest in a new category. Think HomePod or the iPod.
- **and new models**. 
	- **Sell stuff in a new way**: Reimagine how to go to market by creating new revenue streams, channels, and ways of creating value. This can be as simple as moving to a subscription model, or as transformative as Apple’s creating iTunes.
- Deciding which ways to grow needs to be intentional — not driven by luck. 
- Innovation budgets are finite, so allocations of your scarce resources should reduce risk and focus on the best bets. It needs to be balanced for maximum return the same way a retirement fund needs to be balanced among high and low risks and rewards.
