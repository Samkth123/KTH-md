Summary:
The first step to generating real growth is to understand where it comes from. 
It can be boiled down to six simple categories: 
- new processes, 
- new experiences, 
- new features, 
- new customers, 
- new offerings, 
- and new models. 
- Deciding which ways to grow needs to be intentional â€” not driven by luck. 
- Innovation budgets are finite, so allocations of your scarce resources should reduce risk and focus on the best bets. It needs to be balanced for maximum return the same way a retirement fund needs to be balanced among high and low risks and rewards.
