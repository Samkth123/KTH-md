A change in strategy is called pivot, example starting to build a videogame that flops but using the backend made to do something else like a messaging app

A pivot is in Lean Startup methodology a "structural course correction"

â€œthe central strategic challenge for an entrepreneur is how to choose their strategy"

Entrepreneurial firms that cultivate user communities who strongly identify with the firm can be threatened by a pivot

firms make a strategic change when they perceive a performance gap between their target and expected performance
- mature firms after having history 
- entrepreneurial firms without

In other words, a learning-from-doing strategy may be more relevant to entrepreneurial firms than the identification of a performance gap
