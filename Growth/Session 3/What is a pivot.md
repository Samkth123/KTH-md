A change in strategy is called pivot, example starting to build a videogame that flops but using the backend made to do something else like a messaging app

A pivot is in Lean Startup methodology a "structural course correction"

â€œthe central strategic challenge for an entrepreneur is how to choose their strategy"

Entrepreneurial firms that cultivate user communities who strongly identify with the firm can be threatened by a pivot

firms make a strategic change when they perceive a performance gap between their target and expected performance
- mature firms after having history 
- entrepreneurial firms without

In other words, a learning-from-doing strategy may be more relevant to entrepreneurial firms than the identification of a performance gap


First, the strategic change literature theorizes that firms are motivated to change when new information illuminates a gap between a firm's target outcome and its expected performance
- However, firms in uncertain contexts can amass volumes of data that elicit conflicting interpretations, so such comparisons can be unclear.
- Identifying clear, concrete outcomes to compare a firm's performance in relation to its business environment is not easily done for any firm, but this is particularly true for entrepreneurial firms, which lack a long history of performance to form a basis for comparison

Second, examination of strategic change tends to equate change as positive, often assuming that strategic change was the correct and necessary decision, rather than evaluating what prompted decision-makers to select or reject change contemporaneously. 
- For example, Barr et al. (1992) define the alternative to strategic change as strategic decline
