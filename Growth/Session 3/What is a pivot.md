A change in strategy is called pivot, example starting to build a videogame that flops but using the backend made to do something else like a messaging app

A pivot is in Lean Startup methodology a "structural course correction"

“the central strategic challenge for an entrepreneur is how to choose their strategy"

Entrepreneurial firms that cultivate user communities who strongly identify with the firm can be threatened by a pivot

firms make a strategic change when they perceive a performance gap between their target and expected performance
- mature firms after having history 
- entrepreneurial firms without

In other words, a learning-from-doing strategy may be more relevant to entrepreneurial firms than the identification of a performance gap


First, the strategic change literature theorizes that firms are motivated to change when new information illuminates a gap between a firm's target outcome and its expected performance
- However, firms in uncertain contexts can amass volumes of data that elicit conflicting interpretations, so such comparisons can be unclear.
- Identifying clear, concrete outcomes to compare a firm's performance in relation to its business environment is not easily done for any firm, but this is particularly true for entrepreneurial firms, which lack a long history of performance to form a basis for comparison

Second, examination of strategic change tends to equate change as positive, often assuming that strategic change was the correct and necessary decision, rather than evaluating what prompted decision-makers to select or reject change contemporaneously. 
- For example, Barr et al. (1992) define the alternative to strategic change as strategic decline

### WHEN FIRMS DECIDE TO CHANGE THEIR STRATEGIES

When confronted with information triggers that prompted a new strategy question, decisionmakers considered strategic change. In these moments, entrepreneurs began to question their commitment to their current strategy—indicating some degree of receptivity to change (e.g., Gavetti & Rivkin, 2007). 
- All firms encountered two types of triggers during the time of study: Problems and opportunities

Despite the fact that six out of seven firms chose to make a strategic change at least once during the period of study, only three firms ultimately pivoted. 
- However, a pivot did not occur as the product of one decision. When firm decision-makers chose to make a strategic change, they changed one element of their strategy at a time, but not the overall strategy. 
- When pivots did occur, they unfolded through an accumulation of incremental strategic decisions, independently triggered by either problems or opportunities

**Strategic Change** is considered any alteration in the firm's strategy, which can include changes in products, markets, technologies, or organizational processes. These changes can be prompted by new information that conflicts with the firm’s existing beliefs or expands upon them. Strategic changes can be incremental, involving the addition of new elements to the strategy (strategic additions) or the discontinuation of existing elements (strategic exits) without necessarily altering the overall strategic direction of the firm.
