A change in strategy is called pivot, example starting to build a videogame that flops but using the backend made to do something else like a messaging app

A pivot is in Lean Startup methodology a "structural course correction"

“the central strategic challenge for an entrepreneur is how to choose their strategy"

Entrepreneurial firms that cultivate user communities who strongly identify with the firm can be threatened by a pivot

firms make a strategic change when they perceive a performance gap between their target and expected performance
- mature firms after having history 
- entrepreneurial firms without

In other words, a learning-from-doing strategy may be more relevant to entrepreneurial firms than the identification of a performance gap


First, the strategic change literature theorizes that firms are motivated to change when new information illuminates a gap between a firm's target outcome and its expected performance
- However, firms in uncertain contexts can amass volumes of data that elicit conflicting interpretations, so such comparisons can be unclear.
- Identifying clear, concrete outcomes to compare a firm's performance in relation to its business environment is not easily done for any firm, but this is particularly true for entrepreneurial firms, which lack a long history of performance to form a basis for comparison

Second, examination of strategic change tends to equate change as positive, often assuming that strategic change was the correct and necessary decision, rather than evaluating what prompted decision-makers to select or reject change contemporaneously. 
- For example, Barr et al. (1992) define the alternative to strategic change as strategic decline

### WHEN FIRMS DECIDE TO CHANGE THEIR STRATEGIES

When confronted with information triggers that prompted a new strategy question, decisionmakers considered strategic change. In these moments, entrepreneurs began to question their commitment to their current strategy—indicating some degree of receptivity to change (e.g., Gavetti & Rivkin, 2007). 
- All firms encountered two types of triggers during the time of study: Problems and opportunities

Despite the fact that six out of seven firms chose to make a strategic change at least once during the period of study, only three firms ultimately pivoted. 
- However, a pivot did not occur as the product of one decision. When firm decision-makers chose to make a strategic change, they changed one element of their strategy at a time, but not the overall strategy. 
- When pivots did occur, they unfolded through an accumulation of incremental strategic decisions, independently triggered by either problems or opportunities

**Strategic Change** is considered any alteration in the firm's strategy, which can include changes in products, markets, technologies, or organizational processes. These changes can be prompted by new information that conflicts with the firm’s existing beliefs or expands upon them. Strategic changes can be incremental, involving the addition of new elements to the strategy (strategic additions) or the discontinuation of existing elements (strategic exits) without necessarily altering the overall strategic direction of the firm.

**A Pivot**, on the other hand, is defined as a significant change that reorients the firm's strategic direction. It involves a reallocation or restructuring of the firm’s activities, resources, and attention, leading to a new strategic course. A pivot is not achieved through a single decision or change but is the result of an accumulation of multiple strategic decisions over time. These decisions collectively lead to a substantial shift in the firm's strategy, moving it in a new direction.


### When is a firm's strategy at risk for change?

When a team encountered new information that aligned with or confirmed their expectations, the firm continued with its activities unaffected. 

When new information stimulated decision-makers to question their current strategy, they were prompted to engage in strategic decision-making. 
- In these moments, decision-makers considered strategy change. 
- Triggers that prompted strategy questions varied in the favorability of the potential impact on the firm
	- A trigger's content could refer to a firm's technology, such as when Joule's prototype literally exploded on the lab bench and prompted the team to question whether they should continue developing that product. 
	- A trigger's content could also refer to a firm's target market, such as when Ergon was invited by a potential partner to begin sales in a new country, prompting Ergon's CEO to question whether they should expand internationally. 
	- A trigger's content most commonly related to financial needs or potential funding sources, such as when Ohm's low bank balance prompted the board to question whether the firm should take on venture debt. 
	- Triggers could also stem from organizational activities such as when a miscommunication within Gauss’ leadership triggered a question about quarterly and annual personnel and firm target metrics. 
	- Finally, new supply chain information could also trigger strategic decisions such as when Coulomb's conversations with potential investors from across their industry prompted the team to question where in the industry's value chain Coulomb should position itself.
	- The information presented by a trigger could pose either a problem or an opportunity for the firm's current strategy.


### When do firms choose strategic change?


"You would only want to bring in-house something where you have a differentiating core competency. If a subcontractor can do it anyway then what's the point of me replicating that in-house? What strategic advantage does that give me?

##### Neglecting strategic change
- New information alligns with existing beliefs
- Firms may also neglect strategic change if decision-makers perceive that the new information, while potentially valuable, does not justify the risks associated with altering their strategic direction
- In cases where the new information is ambiguous or does not create a sense of urgency, firms may choose to maintain their current strategic direction. - can adopt wait and see approach

##### Choosing strategic change
- In these cases, when decision-makers found that new information conflicted with or expanded the beliefs they held about their firms, their technologies, or their strategies, they opted to change some element of the firm's strategy
- As these examples illustrate, the entrepreneurial firms in our study that chose strategic change did not do so to renew a formerly successful strategy or as a means to respond to competitive pressures from others. 
	- Rather, they chose to change their strategies after new information conflicted with or expanded the beliefs they held about their firms, their technologies, or their strategies.



The type of strategic change firms chose depended on the favorability of the new information that triggered decision-making. 
- Strategic exits were triggered only by problems 
	- In each case when firms chose a strategic exit, they made that choice without knowing what would fill the hole in their strategy.
	- After decision-makers at these three firms (entrepreneurial firms) encountered problems that conflicted with their beliefs, they chose a strategic exit. 
		- Unlike the “trimming” of strategy elements done at mature firms like Vanguard, when entrepreneurial firms in our study made a strategic exit, this decision left a gap in their strategies with no backup or alternative strategy to fill this gap. 
		- In other words, having a strategy gap did not in itself trigger a subsequent strategic decision. 
		- When strategic exits happened, the entrepreneurial teams in our study continued to work on fundraising, technology, and market development until they acquired new information in the form of an opportunity that triggered a new strategy question.
- Strategic additions were triggered only by opportunities.


When decision-makers’ beliefs were unaffected by a trigger, they rejected the option to change their strategies
- Decisionmakers only chose to change their strategies after the beliefs underlying that strategy were affected by new information. 
- Decision-makers affected by a problem trigger accepted that the new information conflicted with their beliefs and chose a strategic exit without identifying a replacement strategy. 
- When decision-makers’ beliefs were affected by an unanticipated opportunity, they expanded their beliefs and made a strategic addition, adding a new element to their strategy.


**Inte viktigt info, bara intro till nästa del:** In sum, we found that the type of strategic change selected depended on the relationship between the favorability of the new information that triggered decision-making and the decision-makers’ beliefs about their firm's strategy. But not all strategic changes produced a pivot. By analyzing each firm's pattern of decision-making over time, we assessed how and when decisions about strategic change accumulated into a pivot and reoriented the firms’ strategy.

### WHEN DOES STRATEGIC CHANGE BECOME A PIVOT?

When entrepreneurial firms chose to change their strategies, they changed only one element in their strategies at a time.
- But this occurred within the context of multiple, independently triggered decisions.
- They did not, in one decision, opt for a complete strategic reorientation through the reallocation or restructuring of activities, resources, and attention.

Firm strategies evolved as decision-makers made strategy exits and additions after new information acquired during the process of developing new innovations triggered strategic decision-making. 
- When firms chose to make a strategic exit, they left a significant gap in their strategies, which was left unaddressed until decision-makers confronted a new opportunity and opted to make a strategic addition that could address this strategy gap
- When firms chose to make a strategic addition, they did not inherently redefine the direction of the firm with one decision. 

Firms that pivoted did so through the gradual accumulation of multiple strategic decisions over time, adding and exiting elements to their strategy, rather than reorienting the firm's strategy with one decision


**Bästa förklaringen av pivot och vad det är:**
- A pivot was not produced with a single decision to change the firm from one strategy to another, but rather the product of multiple independently triggered decisions that unfold over time.

- A firm pivots by exiting and adding elements to a strategy one at a time, eventually producing a cumulative reallocation or restructuring of activities, resources, and attention

- Our informants used the term only to refer to a strategy transition in retrospect
-  This suggests that, for the entrepreneurial firms we studied, a pivot was not a single decision to change strategic orientation, but rather a way to make sense of the difference between two phases in the evolution of the firm's strategy.

The term pivot implies a single choice to spin like a basketball player, keeping one foot planted while changing the direction the firm is facing—as if Stewart Butterfield spun around from an online-video game to Flickr in one swift move. Furthermore, stories of entrepreneurs like Butterfield who are serial, successful pivoters imply such actions are the norm for entrepreneurial firms. Yet, in our study, we found that pivots were not accomplished with one sweeping strategic decision or single catalyzing event, but rather through the accumulation of a series of decisions to either exit or add elements to the strategy over time.

Pivoting firms made both strategic additions and strategic exits; while firms that did not pivot made only strategic additions.

As suggested by the quote at the beginning of this article, pivot stories told by entrepreneurs and in the popular press often focus on the strategic exit: Each of the games in Stewart Butterfield's case was a strategic exit



Pivot is more radical and entails multiple strategic changes, a pivot encompasses the changes

Problems and opportunities trigger pivots and strategic change
