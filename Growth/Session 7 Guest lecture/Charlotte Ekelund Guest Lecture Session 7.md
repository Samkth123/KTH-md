Do both cofounders have the same vision? Porsche in a year or want to revolutionize xyz...
- samma gäller när ta in investors

I början så gör man allt så då är man cofounder inte CEO

To run a company atleast one cofounder must be able to sell
- and if you dont know hot to sell need to learn

Need revenue in company because investments comes from that

If want fundraising before mvp som hon
- 4 möten per dag med investerare

But if you are pre revenue, you need to have atleast something to show for. 
The example would be that customers would sign a sheet that they would try you.


When stress for hiring people fast:
- good recruitment in a startup is an ongoing thing
- important to hire operations person that can set up financial stuff etc
- as ceo its best to do what you are good at ex selling

How do you attract people when cant pay them well?
- quick wins: flexible work, bonus scheme (ex get part of increased sales), birthdays off
- options:
	- either only c-level or all first 20 employees
	- Queso stock thing sweden? But does not work for remote workers
- 100 day plan
	- tell employees welcome but 80% of you wont be here in a few months because we keep the best only
	- have deliverables first 3 months, and if they dont deliver it then they will step up their game
- Hire admin people before hiring sales people

3 ways of driving growth in saas
- email and calling
- marketing growth - people see your stuff then in funnel
- product like growth - everytime have an external meeting they get into your product ex teemco

Need to know if we need marketing people or sales people first then the other
- wait before hiring entire sales team

Timing and role of a CPO:
- product is intersection of marketing and technology
- some people have cpo for product marketing and one for tech

When gut tells hire is wrong:
- fire people fast if need
