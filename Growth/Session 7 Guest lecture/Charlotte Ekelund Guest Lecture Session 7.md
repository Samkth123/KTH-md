Do both cofounders have the same vision? Porsche in a year or want to revolutionize xyz...
- samma gäller när ta in investors

I början så gör man allt så då är man cofounder inte CEO

To run a company atleast one cofounder must be able to sell
- and if you dont know hot to sell need to learn

Need revenue in company because investments comes from that

If want fundraising before mvp som hon
- 4 möten per dag med investerare

But if you are pre revenue, you need to have atleast something to show for. 
The example would be that customers would sign a sheet that they would try you.
