### The growth process


Life cycle models
Usually include 3 stages.

First is founder important, the type of company where you just go to founder to ask something if you are employee ex creativity stage or existence stage 

Then moves on to stage where firm has achieved som milestone, example first product or market success things. Ex Direction, gogo stage, ...

Then more mature state, and has increased bureaucratiation ex Co-ordingation, resource-matruiry, bereaucracy

Growth becomes a challenge when the firm grows but managers/foudners dont develop competence to manage it with its growth. The managerial capacity is low. Employees will suffer if this happens as well as the founders.




The framework helps ensure sustainable growth as it makes you manage different aspects of the business simultaneously, so its not like the other models
#### Horizon 1
Core business
Focus on cash flow and profit and revenue
Improving existing products

ex: Ericsson 5G

#### Horizon 2
Find new opportunities that could bring cash flow and become significant revenue streams
Example adjecent markets or new customer segments
Goal is to turn these new opportunities into Horizon 1 businesses

ex: Ericsson phones in the past 

### Horizon 3
Look at trends and future innovations
Plant seed for future growth by investing in R&D

ex: AI research R&D


#### ADVANTAGES
More "real applicable"
Easy to grasp
Growth model that focuses on diversifying business - protects about sudden market changes


#### Disadvantages
Only for established businesses, and harder to use for smaller businesses
- Small company can only focus on horizon 1

Challenge of balancing resources, how much should be spent on second horizon

Each horizons need managing in their own way, and success in own does not mean success in another
