### The growth process


Life cycle models
Usually include 3 stages.

First is founder important, the type of company where you just go to founder to ask something if you are employee ex creativity stage or existence stage 

Then moves on to stage where firm has achieved som milestone, example first product or market success things. Ex Direction, gogo stage, ...

Then more mature state, and has increased bureaucratiation ex Co-ordingation, resource-matruiry, bereaucracy

Growth becomes a challenge when the firm grows but managers/foudners dont develop competence to manage it with its growth. The managerial capacity is low. Employees will suffer if this happens as well as the founders.



##### Baghai 

The point of this model is that something that is experimental can have potential and you put more investments into it and make it maybe horizon 2 or horizon 1...

The framework helps companies have sustainable growth as it makes you manage different aspects of the business simultaneously, so its not like the other models.

Basically has three levels of security i would say, where horizon one is the most stable and horizon 3 the least.
#### Horizon 1
Core business
Focus on cash flow and profit and revenue
Improving existing products

ex: Ericsson 5G

#### Horizon 2
Find new opportunities that could bring cash flow and become significant revenue streams
Example adjecent markets or new customer segments
Goal is to turn these new opportunities into Horizon 1 businesses

ex: Ericsson phones in the past 

### Horizon 3
Look at trends and future innovations
Plant seed for future growth by investing in R&D

ex: AI research R&D


#### ADVANTAGES
More "real applicable"
Easy to grasp
Growth model that focuses on diversifying business - protects about sudden market changes


#### Disadvantages
Only for established businesses, and harder to use for smaller businesses
- Small company can only focus on horizon 1

Challenge of balancing resources, how much should be spent on second horizon

Each horizons need managing in their own way, and success in own does not mean success in another

##### Greiner model

First of its kind - benchmark to others
Simplistic
Limited

Different phases and each phase begins with growth (evolution) and then you come to a crisis (revolution) and when each crisis is dealt with you come to next growing stage.

key difference from greiner is....


##### Adizes

birth to death instead of birth to success
drawbacks?

##### Diamond

Anything about company in one stage or other?
limitation is that its not change over night, but the model is not explicit abouy how to handle the transitions

#### PROS AND CONS OF STAGE MODELS
pros:
Many entreprenours 
- can locate their venture in one of the stages
- find the models useful to pinpoint potential problems and think about solutions

Cons:
Models suggest that
- there is one path
- firms go through ALL stages
- best suited for organic growth
- limited empirical evidence



### Growth modes
Fancy word of how firms grow

Organic growth
or
Inorganic growth:
- Acquisitions, merger or minority investment = Equity investments
- Joint venture or strategic alliances = Partnership based
- Franchising or licensing = Replication/contract-based


##### Organic growth
Organic growth means growing through own internal processes and resources.
If grow internationally organically you start your own factory in another country
- It relies on a consistent flow of ideas and development
Generally found to drive long-term performance
Howere it is challenging and requires:
-  continuously challenging existing think and prcatices
- being tuned in to changes in the market
- rigourous customer monitoring and
- efficient internal control and communication

Innovation is a key driver of organic growth
Three main types of innovation
- product innovation (ex R&D ) ex IBM
- Market innovation (business model innovation - finding new ways to deliver value)ex IKEA
- Process innovation (operational efficiency) ex Ford or porsche here operation efficiceny is important because drives down cost

##### Growth by acquisition
Acquisitive growth is growth achived by firm external sources typically taking control of or merging with other companies
- Relies on synergies or other added value 1+ 1 > 2
- Often fails to deliver shareholder returns due to integration related challenges

Need to do this in a way employees of acquired company wants to stay
Generally unable to fully replace organic growth

Instead acquisitions:
- should strengthen or transform present competitive advantages
- may target under-valued companies or specific resources/competencies
- may be a management buyouy (MBO, shareholder sell to existing managers)

Firms primarly use acquisitions to secure subsequent organic growth ie to
- Quickly gain minimum scale in new markets (coca cola buying a company in china to go there quicker)
- Gain acces to specific capabilities (ex apple buying beats for its music tech)



##### Other growth modes
Growth by merger
- in practice similar to acquisitions
- More common among large corporations
- Post-deal integration is challenging (costs, conflicting interestest and cu)
