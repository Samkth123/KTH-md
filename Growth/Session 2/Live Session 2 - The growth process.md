### The growth process


Life cycle models
Usually include 3 stages.

First is founder important, the type of company where you just go to founder to ask something if you are employee ex creativity stage or existence stage 

Then moves on to stage where firm has achieved som milestone, example first product or market success things. Ex Direction, gogo stage, ...

Then more mature state, and has increased bureaucratiation ex Co-ordingation, resource-matruiry, bereaucracy

Growth becomes a challenge when the firm grows but managers/foudners dont develop competence to manage it with its growth. The managerial capacity is low. Employees will suffer if this happens as well as the founders.



##### Baghai 

The point of this model is that something that is experimental can have potential and you put more investments into it and make it maybe horizon 2 or horizon 1...

The framework helps companies have sustainable growth as it makes you manage different aspects of the business simultaneously, so its not like the other models.

Basically has three levels of security i would say, where horizon one is the most stable and horizon 3 the least.
#### Horizon 1
Core business
Focus on cash flow and profit and revenue
Improving existing products

ex: Ericsson 5G

#### Horizon 2
Find new opportunities that could bring cash flow and become significant revenue streams
Example adjecent markets or new customer segments
Goal is to turn these new opportunities into Horizon 1 businesses

ex: Ericsson phones in the past 

### Horizon 3
Look at trends and future innovations
Plant seed for future growth by investing in R&D

ex: AI research R&D


#### ADVANTAGES
More "real applicable"
Easy to grasp
Growth model that focuses on diversifying business - protects about sudden market changes


#### Disadvantages
Only for established businesses, and harder to use for smaller businesses
- Small company can only focus on horizon 1

Challenge of balancing resources, how much should be spent on second horizon

Each horizons need managing in their own way, and success in one does not mean success in another

##### Greiner model

First of its kind - benchmark to others
Simplistic
Limited

Different phases and each phase begins with growth (evolution) and then you come to a crisis (revolution) and when each crisis is dealt with you come to next growing stage. 


##### Summarize churchill model

key difference from greiner is....


##### Adizes

birth to death instead of birth to success
drawbacks?

##### Diamond

Anything about company in one stage or other?
limitation is that its not change over night, but the model is not explicit abouy how to handle the transitions

#### PROS AND CONS OF STAGE MODELS
pros:
Many entreprenours 
- can locate their venture in one of the stages
- find the models useful to pinpoint potential problems and think about solutions

Cons:
Models suggest that
- there is one path
- firms go through ALL stages
- best suited for organic growth
- limited empirical evidence



### Growth modes
Fancy word of how firms grow

Organic growth
or
Inorganic growth:
- Acquisitions, merger or minority investment = Equity investments
- Joint venture or strategic alliances = Partnership based
- Franchising or licensing = Replication/contract-based


##### Organic growth
Organic growth means growing through own internal processes and resources.
If grow internationally organically you start your own factory in another country
- It relies on a consistent flow of ideas and development
Generally found to drive long-term performance
Howere it is challenging and requires:
-  continuously challenging existing think and prcatices
- being tuned in to changes in the market
- rigourous customer monitoring and
- efficient internal control and communication

Innovation is a key driver of organic growth
Three main types of innovation
- product innovation (ex R&D ) ex IBM
- Market innovation (business model innovation - finding new ways to deliver value)ex IKEA
- Process innovation (operational efficiency) ex Ford or porsche here operation efficiceny is important because drives down cost

##### Growth by acquisition
Acquisitive growth is growth achived by firm external sources typically taking control of or merging with other companies
- Relies on synergies or other added value 1+ 1 > 2
- Often fails to deliver shareholder returns due to integration related challenges

Need to do this in a way employees of acquired company wants to stay
Generally unable to fully replace organic growth

Instead acquisitions:
- should strengthen or transform present competitive advantages
- may target under-valued companies or specific resources/competencies
- may be a management buyouy (MBO, shareholder sell to existing managers)

Firms primarly use acquisitions to secure subsequent organic growth ie to
- Quickly gain minimum scale in new markets (coca cola buying a company in china to go there quicker)
- Gain acces to specific capabilities (ex apple buying beats for its music tech)


Advantage:
- Rapid growth, 
- Easier - easier to buy a factory that produces something with trained employees than bulding it from scratch
- You dont only get physical things of the company, but rather to new connections especially in newer countries you get access to management that knows people (access to local management)
- Reduces political risk when expanding internationally (outsider to country you might not know a lot of stuff in the company - especially if its in highly regulated market ex green energy)

Cons:
- High initial investments
- Uncertain return on investment
- Legacy of the acquired company. May be difficult to coordinate. Target firm can have different culture from yours, and integration might be hard if yours is very different. Ex fashion companies care less about integration because they want target to keep its vibe because that might be why they from the start acquired them.


##### Other growth modes

##### Growth by merger
- in practice similar to acquisitions
- More common among large corporations
- Post-deal integration is challenging (costs, conflicting interestest and cultures)
- Antitrust law can prevent mergers (ex critical industries like airlines)

##### Minority investments 
- one company buying some part in another company, ex ANT FINANCIAL bought small stake in Klarna

##### Joint ventures
- Sony Ericsson?, Marriott & Alibaba, Volvo & Daimler
- Special type of alliance which are explicit in goal and in terms and conditions
- Usually make it because you want to tex develop fuel cell technology and its very contractual in as how much u get and how long
- Two or more firms create new business entity seperate from its parent
- The parents firms share ownership of the net business entity

Joint venture is its own legal entity, and if sued it is itself not the parent companies that get sued

PROS:
- Acess to expertise and contacts in local markets when expanding internaionally (International partner)
- Reduce political risk
- Shared resources and risks
- Possible win-win
Cons
- Potential conflict due to different objectives
- The importance of the venture to each party may change over time (Might start in horizon 3 and one firm gets it to horizon 2, so might be clash here)
- Cultural clashes
- Lack of full control over the joint venture operations

##### Strategic alliances
- Samsung and Spotify
- Basically spotify has more seamless experience on samsung devices

##### Franchising and licensning
- Both entail replication, but licensing is less restricive than franchising
- Licensing is more popular in creative industries and pharmaceutical industries
	- Basically in industries where there is a recipe to replicate
- Licensing also common for startup where you can give license of your product to larger company
- Licensing often common when there is a visual thing or like pattents? ex hello kity

##### Franchising
- Franshisee operates the business under the name of another company
- A business concept: the franchisor provides the right to use trademarks, operating system, equipment and continuous support systems like advertising, employee training, etc.
- The franchisee paysa fee to start up operations
- The franchisor typically takes a cut out of the sales (subway has 8% royalty plus and additional 4 percent for advertising (because you benefit from the marketing the franchisor does))

Pros:
- low risk and low cost
- Usually highly motivated business contacts with local market knowledge
- Economies of scale in marketing to international customers
- Enables relatively rapid expansion in both domestic and foreign markets

Cons:
- Search for competent franchisees can be expensive and time consuming
- Lack of full control over franchisees operations (can suffer reputational damage if something bad happens at franchisee ex rat in subway of some guy)
- Cost of protecting property rights

##### Licensing
- A licensing agreement is an arrangement wherein the licensor gives something of valuie to the license in exchange for a financial paymetnt ex patent
- Object of a license agreement: patent, trademark (hellokity), manufacturing know-how not subject ot a patent

Pros:
- Increase income on products already developed
- Locally made image may assist sales and dealing with authorities when expanding internationally
- Circumvents trade barriers when expanding internationally

Cons:
- When the licensor agreement expires the company may have created a competitor
- Licensee may  underperform and termination of the contract can be difficuly
- License fees are usually a 

DIfference betwen licensing and franchise: Franchise something acquired, but in licensing hello kity its often large company giving to smaller, but can also be small R&D pharmcacy that give patent to large company so can go both ways.

##### Acquisition
- A growth mode that entails one firm (acquirer) buying another firm (target)
- Generally the acquirer does not have ot but all shares of a target for the transaction to be considered an acquisition but rather 50% + 1 of voting rights (enough to gain control of decision making)
- 

^^^ All these notes are pretty simplified
#### Growth mode strategy

Dominant entry mode: many companies ahve dominant entry mode, a mode they use most times/always ex H&M organic, subway franchsiing, Hello Kitty licensing

Mixed entry mode: Many companies alternate modes depending on the brand and geographical location

ex: starbucks

Growth modes decisions relate to the general firm strategy: One reason Starbycjs entered several licesning deals with Nestle nad PepseCo and sold Tazo to Unilever was to generate money for their expansion in China


What is the difference between votes and equity
- Not all shares have the same voting rights
- B och A aktier?
- Family firms usually sell equity shares but not voting shares
- 10% equity right is 10% of profit but does not have to do with how much vote you have

### 1. Greiner’s Growth Model

**Framework**: Greiner’s Growth Model proposes that businesses go through six phases of growth, each characterized by a period of evolution (where growth occurs through proven strategies) followed by a period of revolution (a crisis that demands a change). The phases are: Creativity, Direction, Delegation, Coordination, Collaboration, and Alliances (inte med egentligen).

**Pros**:

- **Comprehensive Framework**: Offers a broad view of organizational development, highlighting predictable challenges companies face as they grow.
- **Crisis Anticipation**: Helps leaders anticipate problems that typically arise at different stages, preparing them to manage transitions more effectively.

**Cons**:

- **Linear Progression Assumption**: Assumes organizations will move through stages in a linear fashion, which may not always be the case in a dynamic business environment.
- **One-Size-Fits-All Approach**: May not account for the unique aspects of different industries or the impact of external factors like technology and market changes.
- Also, different parts of an organisation move at different speeds?

### 2. Churchill and Lewis Growth Model

**Framework**: The Churchill and Lewis Growth Model focuses on small businesses, outlining five stages of growth: Existence, Survival, Success, Take-off, and Resource Maturity. Each stage describes the company's focus, challenges, opportunities, and organizational structure changes needed for growth.

**Pros**:

- **Small Business Focus**: Specifically addresses the growth challenges and needs of small businesses.
- **Strategic Guidance**: Offers a roadmap for small business owners to understand their current position and what steps they need to take to advance to the next stage.

**Cons**:

- **Limited Scalability**: Primarily designed for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and its applicability to larger corporations or rapidly scaling startups may be limited.
- **Over-Simplification**: May oversimplify the complexities and nuances of business growth by categorizing them into distinct stages.

### 3. Adizes Corporate Lifecycle

**Framework**: The Adizes Corporate Lifecycle describes the lifecycle of a company through ten stages: Courtship, Infancy, Go-go, Adolescence, Prime, Stability, Aristocracy, Recrimination, Bureaucracy, and Death. This model focuses on how management practices need to evolve as the company progresses through these stages to maintain growth and avoid decline.

**Pros**:

- **Management Focus**: Emphasizes the importance of management practices at different stages, offering insights into how to adapt leadership styles and organizational structures.
- **Identifies Decline Early**: Helps in recognizing early signs of organizational decline, providing an opportunity to take corrective actions.

**Cons**:

- **Complexity**: The ten-stage model can be complex to apply, requiring deep understanding and analysis to accurately identify the company's current stage.
- **Pessimistic View of Maturity**: The later stages have a somewhat negative connotation, which may discourage companies from seeing potential for renewal or transformation beyond certain points.

### 4. Diamond Model

“This is a model to be used, not studied, and other features of the model come from practical experience. Unlike the models discussed so far, the stages, though distinguishable, overlap.”

**Framework**: This model proposes seven stages in the growth of a business, summarized by the acronym DIAMOND:

1. **D - Dreaming**: Coming up with the business idea, developing plans, and defining start-up requirements.
2. **I - Initiating**: Implementing the business plan and inspiring others to establish a market presence.
3. **A - Attacking**: Addressing early growth challenges, coping with the business's "adolescence" where it's viable but not yet robust against major market or operational changes.
4. **M - Maturing**: Strengthening the business's structure and operations to ensure sustainability and readiness for future growth.
5. **O - Ongoing**: Managing sustained growth, operational efficiency, and innovation to maintain market relevance.
6. **N - New Directions**: Exploring new markets, products, or services to further expand and diversify the business.
7. **D - Decline or Decision to Exit**: Recognizing when the business is facing decline and making strategic decisions about exiting, transforming, or revitalizing the business.

### Pros:

- **Comprehensive Lifecycle Approach**: Provides a detailed roadmap of the stages a business might go through from inception to potential exit, offering entrepreneurs a long-term view of their journey.
- **Emphasis on Anticipation and Planning**: Encourages foresight and strategic planning at each stage, particularly highlighting the importance of preparing for transitions and potential challenges.
- **Flexibility and Adaptation**: Acknowledges the need for businesses to evolve, adapt, and possibly pivot to new directions as part of their growth and sustainability strategies.

### Cons:

- **Sequential Assumption**: While providing a structured approach, it may imply a linear progression through stages, which doesn't always align with the unpredictable nature of business growth.
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Might not fully account for the unique challenges and opportunities presented by different industries, market conditions, or business models.
- **Overlooked External Factors**: Each stage focuses primarily on internal development and decisions. While external pressures are mentioned, there may not be enough emphasis on the impact of external factors such as economic conditions, technological changes, and competitive dynamics.
