Article basically discusses how a company can safely grow and if companies have growth rates

Better to target minimal growth as downsizing requires severence payouts and such. Also, growth not reaching shareholders targets is dangerous for listed companies

### Minimal growth
3 things influence a companies minimal growth rate:

- Competitive growth
	- A company that can achieve competitive growth to its competitors in the market gives a good sign that it can also achieve minimal growth
- Shareholders growth expectations
	- Another requirement of a companies minimum growth rate is to meet long-term shareholder growth expectations other wise stock price might fall ex.
- Productivity growth
	- Minimum growth rate also determined by how productive the company is and can increase productivity in the long term ex fewer employees needed for same task etc...

Competitive growth is the most important minimal growth rate, and is more realistic than shareholder expectations.


### Maximum growth
Even though companies a minimum growth rate to stay competitive etc, they also have an maximum threshold before growth starts causing too many problem.

- Financial limits
	- A proxy for **maximum long term growth** rate is **sustainable growth** rate which is basically how much you can increase sales and such impairing targets for debt, dividend payouts and return on working capital
	- It is not uncommon for companies to go above this level, but should usually not do so
- Managerial limits
	- A companies growth is also limited by its ability to find, train and integrate new management of good quality at a fast pace
- Market limits
	- Escalating competition for marketshare can affect profitability negatively
	- A company starts reaching its maximal growth when it starts purchasing shares at a cost of profitability

Financial limits tend to be most important for larger companies
Negative effects of management only become obvious when exceeding 25% growth rates
