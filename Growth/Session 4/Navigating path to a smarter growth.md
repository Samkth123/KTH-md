Article basically discusses how a company can safely grow and if companies have growth rates

Better to target minimal growth as downsizing requires severence payouts and such. Also, growth not reaching shareholders targets is dangerous for listed companies

### Minimal growth
3 things influence a companies minimal growth rate:

- Competitive growth
	- A company that can achieve competitive growth to its competitors in the market gives a good sign that it can also achieve minimal growth
- Shareholders growth expectations
	- Another requirement of a companies minimum growth rate is to meet long-term shareholder growth expectations other wise stock price might fall ex.
- Productivity growth
	- Minimum growth rate also determined by how productive the company is and can increase productivity in the long term ex fewer employees needed for same task etc...

Competitive growth is the most important minimal growth rate, and is more realistic than shareholder expectations.


### Maximum growth
Even though companies a minimum growth rate to stay competitive etc, they also have an maximum threshold before growth starts causing too many problem.

- Financial limits
	- A proxy for **maximum long term growth** rate is **sustainable growth** rate which is basically how much you can increase sales and such impairing targets for debt, dividend payouts and return on working capital
	- It is not uncommon for companies to go above this level, but should usually not do so
- Managerial limits
	- A companies growth is also limited by its ability to find, train and integrate new management of good quality at a fast pace
- Market limits
	- Escalating competition for marketshare can affect profitability negatively
	- A company starts reaching its maximal growth when it starts purchasing shares at a cost of profitability

Financial limits tend to be most important for larger companies
Negative effects of management only become obvious when exceeding 25% growth rates


### Smart Growth

A company needs to grow within the confinements of minimal and maximum growth
Most importnat indicators were sustainable and competitive growth rates

Companies that did not stay in their growth corridors did worse than those who did.
- The ones who exceeded max threshold had worse profitability
- The ones who went under the minimum threshold had short term profits but long term lost their competitive market positioning and longterm development

Smart growers:
- Had consistent and realistic targets for growth
- Went after both growth in sales and profit growth simultaneously
- Smart grower can usually improve operational efficiency (which leads to higher sustainable growth rates), which leads to cash being put into high growth areas of the market instead, which can result in higher growth rates over time
- Smart growers also gradually increase their growth corridors and instead of focusing on short term growth that deplet resources unsustainably, they focus on their capacity to grow

### Path to smart growth
A company should grow depends on its situation 

3 suboptimal growth situations:
- Cash starved companies
	- These companies lacked the cash to grow with the competition, which was shown through having a sustainable growth rate under their competitive growth rate
	- Hobsons choice: Either grow at market rate and risk going bankrupt, or grow sustainably but loose market position
	- Two-stage approach to get out of it:
		- First increase cash flow and profitability by refocusing on core business, sell of noncore assets and take steps to improve operational efficiency (ex minimize production cost).
			- These measures increases sustainable growth rate
		- Once company reached a sustainable growth rate that exceeded competitive growth rate, they could "afford" to grow again and invest in market and product initiatives aimed at generating new growth
- Growth laggards
	- These have financial muscle to move in the market, which is shown through having sustainble growth rates above competitive growth rate
	- However, sales increase have fallen behind of competitive growth rate
		- consequently, they experience continuous erosion of their market share
	- This is usually because of lacking innovation and resistance to change
- Companies experiencing excessive growth
	- These companies have outgrown their competition, but grow so rapidly that their financials are stretched thin
		- They experience organisation complexity, higher debt and risk of bankruptcy
	- Companies that successfully managed to go back to smart growth had some type of stabilization program consisting of 3 steps:
		- First, debt is a consequence of massive growth, and therefore they started retrenchment activities such as selling of assets, restructuring debt and cutting costs
