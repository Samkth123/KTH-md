What is a startup? What makes it different from SMEs (esp small enterprices)?
- Defined as a company 5-8 years old
- Still working on identifying/refining its core business
- financed by its founders and /or outside investors/creditors
- able to grow rapidly

Y-combinator rules of thumb for a startup growth required rapid:
- good 5-7% / week
- excelennt >10% /week
- succesfull IPOs associated with higher growth (notably for smaller firms)
Limits:
- loss of financial control (eg budget, cash flow)
- loss of operational control (client complants, poor hiring)
- loss of strategic control (leaving core business, losing tack of vision, burnout)

What is hypergrowth? CAGR (compound annual growth rate)
CAGR > 40%


#### GROWTH RATES: THE GROWTH CORRIDOR
Need to understand logic of growth corridor in test


model is based on profit/equity aka return on profit

### Estableished firms the frowht coridor

Typically a established firm
- is over 5 years old
- hassttled in its core bussiness
- is struggling to sustain growth
how can and should such firms grow?
growth corridor: follow upper limit (sustainable growth rate SGR) (return on equity -dividends) and lower limit ( competitive growth rate (CGR)) (avg sales gtrowht of key competitors)

Useful formula on slide

Possible growth situations:
Different companies are on different stages of growth corridor, ex: cash starved, growth laggard, or excessive growth

ex: BMW went from cash starved and growth laggard to smart growth

AES went from excessive growth to smart growth

cash starved:
- lack the financial means to grow (SGR < CGR)
- can either grow at CGR and go bankrujpt or grow at SGR and lose market share
- typical resolution: a) sell of non core business and b) focus on efficiency in core

growth laggard:
- outgrown by competitors and persistently lose market share (slaes growth < CGR)
- typical resolution: organic growth through innocation (product/market/process)

Excessive growth
- Grow beyond their means, l
