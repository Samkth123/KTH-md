good co foudners pick their battles and know when to be supportive and when to me critical

hiring first freelancers - look for right skillset (not people you can develop, but who have the skills you need)
- outsourced to portugal and china their social media management
- look at their portfolio and such
- Detta är ett väldigt bra sätt att att differentiera ett mindre företag genom bra marknadsföring fast från billiga frilansare

Recruiting for growth
- When have more cashflow and CEO wants to free up time to do tactical work and higher level thinking, working on partnerships, roadmap for growth and such
- Here you recruit people you can develop
- Important to have good onboarding session and important to handpick them
- Have a long list of personality traits that are essential for the company culture want to develop, would recruit for personality and traits rather than technical skills

How onboarded and trained for employees:
- LPPL framework (developed by themselves)
	- Learn (lär noobsen)
	- Prepare (gör dom redo)
	- Practice (practice in safe setting?)
	- Listen (lyssna på folk?)
	- ends with reiterate
- People management är mycket workshops där man brainstormar men även lär sig en massa
