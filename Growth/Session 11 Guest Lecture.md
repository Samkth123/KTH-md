Key takeaways:

First customers through QR CODE vest on themselves so shameless if want to get first customers.

This company did not want investors or external board. She used own money because wanted control of where company going

Had a E-commerce company before

Hard to go through the stages here alone:

good co foudners pick their battles and know when to be supportive and when to me critical

hiring first freelancers - look for right skillset (not people you can develop, but who have the skills you need)
- outsourced to portugal and china their social media management
- look at their portfolio and such
- Detta är ett väldigt bra sätt att att differentiera ett mindre företag genom bra marknadsföring fast från billiga frilansare

Recruiting for growth
- When have more cashflow and CEO wants to free up time to do tactical work and higher level thinking, working on partnerships, roadmap for growth and such
- Here you recruit people you can develop
- Important to have good onboarding session and important to handpick them
- Have a long list of personality traits that are essential for the company culture want to develop, would recruit for personality and traits rather than technical skills

How onboarded and trained for employees:
- LPPL framework (developed by themselves)
	- Learn (lär noobsen)
	- Prepare (gör dom redo)
	- Practice (practice in safe setting?)
	- Listen (lyssna på folk?)
	- ends with reiterate
- People management är mycket workshops där man brainstormar men även lär sig en massa

**How i manage (everyone)**
- importnat to be in the details but not micro manage
- important for employees in small startups to report to you and to others
- möter sina business partners/co foudners every week 1 hour to check if need help with anything and how stuff is going and make sure they are comfortable with coming with issues they need help with
- For the employees have frequent meetings but in team settings.
- The tour guides fill out self assesment sheet after each tour and become self critical, and they tell you what they did wrong and want to fill up to their role, so as manager you just encourage them. They talk to eachother and give feedback to eachother, and the CEO/manager gives instead advice like a coach, instead of tkaing critique from the CEO.

Gets 25% interview instead of 4%
- encourages quantity
- All tour guides get commission based om number of reviews instead of number of good reviews as 1 star reviews are much better than 5 star reviews.
- At end of season the guide with most reviews gets bonus

Customers are the most important

Core values (embody them in everything you do and apply them in every situation of uncertainty) (10 C's):
- Constructive collaboration
- Curiosity and creativity
- Commitment to circuilarity
- Customized Connection
- Continuous Care (i mitten av alla andra C's) ( make sure customers feel deeply cared for and like we understand their needs)

Many CEOs talk about values but do not embody them. Its important to do it and make the team also do it.

So if customer makes something unexpected that you are not prepared for, you can follow the values

missdiagnosis


How did you price your product and how long to get first customer?

- Gained insight from customers on where they book (they are on get your guide)
- She had target audience but did not know how to find them
- The QR code thing was extra after that
- Diversified revenue streams, started with tours (now 60%) but also doing content creation now as they had strong content creation and after a while you will get followers there which can make you get revenue through affiliations and such
- Now working on an app which is in incubator phase and could be its own thing?
	- trying to bulletproof their business as there are many threats to travel so tries to diversify
