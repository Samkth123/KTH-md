Growth is a consequence of success, but still brings organisational challenges that threaten the success that caused it.
- Also, what caused growth last year does not need to do it this year. Organisations that want to sustain growth might need to fix things not broken.

Growth may also attract competitors and competing technologies as well as customers from different markets with different expectations.

In a big business, different divisions grow at different speeds
- This leads to the problem of how to distirbute resources between them


“Growth gives rise to problems for businesses of all sizes. Different divisions in a big business evolve at different speeds and may therefore be at different stages of evolution, each with its own problems, presenting additional challenges to the organisation as a whole: how to reconcile the competing and contradictory plans of one division with another is a particular growth challenge for the bigger business. Mergers, joint ventures and acquisitions – inorganic rather than organic growth options – present even more challenges, not least with integration”
