Businesses are multi dimensional and grow in different ways. If the different elements of a business are plotted on a graph they will not move in parallel.

Companies in different parts of their evolution will experience different kinds of growth. A smaller company can grow a lot, while large companies will be happy with even 10%.


#### Revenue, turnover and sales

Revenue = Gross sales = turnover = "top line"

Revenue appears at the top of the companies income statement.

Turnover is more than just growth, its about how active a company is and the speed of its business engine.

Revenue is the product of price and volume.

Inflation affects prices in the way that the managers have to push up the prices

Revenue is sensitive to the effects of accounting policy
- Management accounting is more an art than a science

Accountants worry about **Revenue recognition** basically when a sale should be booked.
- A company may report numbers for its accounts that are different from those used in the business, ex if they want to make it seem like they have more revenue 

However if accounting policy stays the same year over year and business is fairly consistent, this will not make a big impact on the published number. But changing from a conservative revenue recognition to less conservative will increase reported revenue in one year.

A business that grows revenue but pays too little attention to profits and cash measures will have unsustainable growth and uncertain future.

Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity and cash flow is reality

#### Market share

Big businesses
- Market share is important as it benchmarks you to competition

Small businesses or fragmented industry (nobody dominates it) market share does not matter as much

In a growing industry
- Some people say its easy to grow top line
- Not necessarily true as many new people enter the market and much competition
- A company can increase top line but loose market share

In a shrinking industry
- Companies compete more about aggressive for smaller business
- This puts pressure on sales prices
- However some companies might be rushing to exit leaving those that stay to consolidate a stronger position buy buying up market share

#### Profit/income gross net

No company can survive in the long term without generating profit or income

Profit = "Bottom line"

Growth in profit might come from business decisions that mean decrease in revenue
- Increasing profits might come from cutting staff or unprofitable
