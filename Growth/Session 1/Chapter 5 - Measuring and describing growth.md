Businesses are multi dimensional and grow in different ways. If the different elements of a business are plotted on a graph they will not move in parallel.

Companies in different parts of their evolution will experience different kinds of growth. A smaller company can grow a lot, while large companies will be happy with even 10%.


#### Revenue, turnover and sales

Revenue = Gross sales = turnover = "top line"

Revenue appears at the top of the companies income statement.

Turnover is more than just growth, its about how active a company is.
