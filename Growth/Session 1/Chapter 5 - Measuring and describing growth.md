Businesses are multi dimensional and grow in different ways. If the different elements of a business are plotted on a graph they will not move in parallel.

Companies in different parts of their evolution will experience different kinds of growth. A smaller company can grow a lot, while large companies will be happy with even 10%.


### Revenue, turnover and sales

Revenue = Gross sales = turnover = "top line"

Revenue appears at the top of the companies income statement.

Turnover is more than just growth, its about how active a company is and the speed of its business engine.

Revenue is the product of price and volume.

Inflation affects prices in the way that the managers have to push up the prices

Revenue is sensitive to the effects of accounting policy
- Management accounting is more an art than a science

Accountants worry about **Revenue recognition** basically when a sale should be booked.
- A company may report numbers for its accounts that are different from those used in the business, ex if they want to make it seem like they have more revenue 

However if accounting policy stays the same year over year and business is fairly consistent, this will not make a big impact on the published number. But changing from a conservative revenue recognition to less conservative will increase reported revenue in one year.

A business that grows revenue but pays too little attention to profits and cash measures will have unsustainable growth and uncertain future.

Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity and cash flow is reality

### Market share

Big businesses
- Market share is important as it benchmarks you to competition

Small businesses or fragmented industry (nobody dominates it) market share does not matter as much

In a growing industry
- Some people say its easy to grow top line
- Not necessarily true as many new people enter the market and much competition
- A company can increase top line but loose market share

In a shrinking industry
- Companies compete more about aggressive for smaller business
- This puts pressure on sales prices
- However some companies might be rushing to exit leaving those that stay to consolidate a stronger position buy buying up market share

### Profit/income gross net

No company can survive in the long term without generating profit or income

Profit = "Bottom line"

Growth in profit might come from business decisions that mean decrease in revenue
- Increasing profits might come from cutting staff or unprofitable parts of the business
- This leads to less revenue but higher profits
- In one sense, the business has grown
#### Types of profit

##### Gross profit

Gross profit = Turnover - cost of sales
- Basically the cost attributed to each sale

Gross margin = Gross profit as a percentage of sales
- Basically the health of the underlying engine of the business

Businesses in different industries have different gross profit profiles
- So gross profit only used to measure similar companies in the same industry with eachother

Products in the same company even have different gross profit profiles
- Managers should be careful of valuing high margin products more than low margin ones as they often complement eachother
- ex: Gillete makes more profit on refills than shavers but shavers are needed for refills

Gross profit ignores the backoffice costs and only deducts the cost of the sale
- It is a measure of interest to companies in the same industry that wish to buy the business
- Deciding what to deduct is a matter of judgement when calculating gross profit

##### Net profit
Net profit and net margin (Net profit as a percentage of revenue) is profit after all costs including backoffice costs deducted.

Net profit indicates the ability of a business to generate a return.

Net profit is EBITDA

Price is important as if lowered by sales people to win business, it is hard to increase later.

Example: “For example, a business making a 10% margin decides on a 5% price cut to boost sales. It had been making $10 on every $100 of sales; now it makes only $5 on every $95 of sales, assuming volumes stay the same. A 5% reduction in price has led to a 50% reduction in margin. Volumes will have to more than double to make the 5% price reduction worthwhile.”

Increasing prices is however the easiest and cheapest way of increasing margin

Cost control as a means to increasing profit is a good way of keeping prices low but still increasing margins. ==Viktigt att vara effektiv med kostnader man har==
- ex Southwest used only one plane to keep maintenance low 
- However, cost management in ex people knowledge companies are hard because the largest cost is salaries of the people, and lowering them will make it hard to keep people which will in turn increase costs because of recruitment costs and such


### Determining profit

Determining profit is even harder than determining revenue as also here accounting can change a lot, ex whether or not capitalising expenditure ( putting something as asset rather than cost) can have much impact on the profit.

Not much focus on profit can damage a business long term prospects

Profit can be said to be cutting costs, but taken too far, it can negatively affect long term growth.

Some might argue that the increase in growth can not be done with a maximisation of profit.
- In the short term, it is possible to increase profit by slowing down growth
- Managing the tension between growth and profit is an art not a science

When considering profit for growing a business the term **break even** should be considered, which means that the company has reached a size which makes it cover its own costs. 
- The breakeven point is expressed as the formula: Fixed costs devided by gross margin
- For example, a business venture has fixed costs of $100,000 a year and a gross margin of 25%. Its break-even position is therefore 100,000 ÷ 0.25 = 400,000. In other words, when sales reach $400,000 a year the business will cover its fixed costs and break even.
- Breakeven is an important point to reach in a business
- The healthier the margin, the quicker the breakeven will be reached and the easier it will be to sustain profitability


### Headcount and asset capacity

Headcount is the number of staff on the payroll and amounts for the extent of resources are deployed.

Government bodies use headcount as a proxy indicator of a companies size - A bigger business usually hires more people

Asset capacity measures or profitability measures can show how much profit a particular asset generates ex by dividing net profit by cost of fixed assets to assess how much profit fixed assets are generating.

Annual profit divided by annual employement costs to see how much profit is given by employee
- A good indication of changing to bad times is declining profit per employee for a business ambitious for growth

Revenue and headcount curves do not however move in parallel as the above measure is not that good, as ahead of good times we recruit more and when the business anticipates worse times they cut back on business.

Headcount also varies a lot based on business ex portfolio company can generate much profit with only a few employees.

Headcount is a good measure of growth.

Employee turnover (aka people leaving the company) is also a good measure for a company looking to grow its business as you do not only need to be good at recruiting new staff buy also retaining them.

### Growth - The shareholders perspective

Here the most important perspective is the one from the owners perspective

Investments in companies should be compared to other investments to see if they are good or not

Share price of a listed company reflects the value the market sees in the company
- But value even in listed companies is more slippery than share price might suggest
- Ex a company wanting to buy another will often need to pay a premium to make the shareholders sell 

##### Private companies
If a company will be broken up the only value it has is its assets it can sell

Companies assessment of value are also their future ability to make generate cash, often expressed as P/E price/earnings ratio.

The value is very subjective and also sensitive to the discount factor which itself is based on well educated guesses

Shareholder value in a private business can only be determined when the company is sold

##### People businesses and partnerships

When owner-managers sell their company they withdraw their own contributions to the business which significantly lowers its value.
- This is often seen in professional services companies, where there are more partnerships rather than clients and such
- Parnterships suite people businesses and not asset-intensive ones, as the company brand is highly linkedin with the person owning it
- Despite knowledge-management revolution, most of the knowledge are in the owners heads
- Partnerships help people take advantage of scale and the efficiency of working in proximity of people with complementary skills

In such companies, when the senior members want to sell and retire, it is hard because selling their shares to retire is not fair to junior members, as they will both "have the cake and eat it" as when they have sold their shares the value of the company goes down.
- Therefore, many people-businesses are not made for aggregating value but rather for distributing income
- The most significant capital needed in many people-businesses are working capital
	- Capital is not needed to finance assets and surplus financial capital does not necessarily generate a high return on anything else
- Senior partners might try to get a deal with consolidators to get some money out before they retire, but then put burden on the junior partners, who now both need to work more as the seniors reputation in the firm is gone as well as now share the cake with more stakeholders as consolidators have come in.

Professional services firms often don't include "goodwill" (an intangible asset that may include reputation, client relationships, etc.) when they assess their company's equity value.
^^This is a problem in such companies


##### External shareholders

Too much attention to shareholders to the detriment of stakeholders is bad in the long term
- Usually happens because of equity incentives of managers
- This makes short term gain more lucrative than long term
- Increase in shareholder value is easier to measure than stakeholder value


### Range and depth

Need to increase range and depth of products to have sustainable business proposition

Some managers speak of 8020 rule which is that 80% of revenue comes from 20% of the business.
- Therefore successful growth comes from not only acquiring new business but also right kind of business


Other measures of growth can be anything from oil barrels sold to happiness in Bhutan...


### Difficulties of pace and assessment

Younger businesses are harder to asses as they are small and have no history, and therefore it is hard to see any established business practice
- This makes it more difficult to look at trends as they have no history

In owner-manager businesses, the line between the business and owner becomes blurred and it is hard to assess the performance of the underlying business regardless of size.
- Also, the accounting can be weirder here as the owner does what he wants to the business as long as its legitimate

In younger businesses, the owner might not take a salary, and therefore the financial statements might be distorted in any direction, and the true cost of doing business might not be shown.

Companies can not only focus on one measure of growth.
- Growing revenue but not profits do not create value in the long term
- Growing profit but not turn over are on a unsustainable growth path
- Growing profit and revenue but do not earn their cost of capital run out of investors

There is also no relationship between ease of measurement of business practice and how important it is


##### The complications of change

A company that is evolving and expanding, new product lines can have impact on performance and nature of figures reported

Growth also rarely happens linearly
- Business investing in next stage of development might put pressure on margins until the investment is paid back

Fixed costs and variable costs are not as distinguishable as one would like.
