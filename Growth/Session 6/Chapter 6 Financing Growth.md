This requires skilful management of the balance sheet, making sure that cash flows through the business as efficiently as possible and that the balance sheet is not unnecessarily weighed down with assets such as trade debtors and stock or inventory, which might otherwise be converted to cash.

"**trade debtors**" refers to the amounts of money owed to a business by its customers who have purchased goods or services on credit. Essentially, these are the accounts receivable of the company. The term emphasizes that these amounts are due from business transactions or trade.

Business managers who are good at managing cash are aware of how much cash is tied up in various parts of the business and how long it sticks there; and they are good at clearing unnecessary blockages

In some businesses, such as bookshops, stock is slow-moving. In others, such as supermarkets, it moves much faster.

Businesses that pay their suppliers immediately are at a cashflow disadvantage to those that pay their creditors on terms. The longer the terms a business can negotiate with its suppliers, the longer the business can keep cash in the business, and the less it has to rely on external sources for the cash to finance the business.
