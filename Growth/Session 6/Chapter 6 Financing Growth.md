This requires skilful management of the balance sheet, making sure that cash flows through the business as efficiently as possible and that the balance sheet is not unnecessarily weighed down with assets such as trade debtors and stock or inventory, which might otherwise be converted to cash.

"**trade debtors**" refers to the amounts of money owed to a business by its customers who have purchased goods or services on credit. Essentially, these are the accounts receivable of the company. The term emphasizes that these amounts are due from business transactions or trade.

Business managers who are good at managing cash are aware of how much cash is tied up in various parts of the business and how long it sticks there; and they are good at clearing unnecessary blockages

In some businesses, such as bookshops, stock is slow-moving. In others, such as supermarkets, it moves much faster.

Businesses that pay their suppliers immediately are at a cashflow disadvantage to those that pay their creditors on terms. The longer the terms a business can negotiate with its suppliers, the longer the business can keep cash in the business, and the less it has to rely on external sources for the cash to finance the business.

Big businesses can and often do dictate payment terms to small businesses. When the recession struck, some big businesses told their customers that they expected payment within two weeks rather than 30 days. Most businesses, especially big businesses, find it easier to bully their suppliers than their customers.

Effective cost management requires a ruthless examination of the detail and an ability to distinguish the critical from the merely useful. Companies that are growing quickly are under more pressure than stable companies to protect their margins. A growing company needs to be careful with its prices. A price reduction might increase the rate of growth but put additional pressure on profit, which will be under pressure because of growth in the first place.


Big companies that want to strengthen their cash position, however, will work hard at reducing costs as well as adjusting the timing of their cash flows.

Sometimes margin and cash management pull in different directions. Offering discounts to encourage swift payment on the part of customers may speed up the flow of cash into the business significantly. But such discounting can cut heavily into margins and as with all price cuts will go straight to the bottom line

Taking advantage of a purchase discount by paying suppliers quickly may improve margins (though not as much as choosing not to offer a sales discount), but it might put pressure on a business’s cash resources as cash will have to leave the business sooner.

### Managing the investment in growth

Growth is costly. In the long term it may be the only way to secure a sustainable business, but in the short term it will cost money. A growing business must reinvest in itself and will need increasing amounts of working capital (the amount of resources tied up in the balance sheet in the cash cycle).

Many growing businesses, especially business-to-business ones with reliable customers, take advantage of asset-based finance, borrowing mainly against debtors and occasionally against inventory as well

Neil Churchill and John Mullins in a 2001 article in Harvard Business Review:
(it is possible to calculate to what extent cash constraints determined by cash flows in and out of a business will allow the business to grow):

- A business that ties up cash unnecessarily on the balance sheet in the form of excess inventory or uncollected debtors is putting itself under unnecessary cash pressure.
- A business that is paying its suppliers more quickly than necessary is putting itself under unnecessary cash pressure.
- The higher a business’s margins, the greater its cash-generating capability is likely to be.
- The faster a business grows, the more pressure it will put on its cash resources.

### Growing too fast

A business that is growing too fast is overtrading. As with many growth problems, it is ironic that the problem of overtrading is a product of success. In the simplest terms, a business that is overtrading is attempting to do too much with the cash resources at its disposal. 
(**Overtrading** refers to a situation where a business expands its operations more quickly than its financial resources can support)

**A business facing overtrading** has three options:

- To generate more cash, faster, from the business itself. This is unlikely to work. In a business that is overtrading every element is already being tested to the utmost.
- To slow growth down, which is also surprisingly difficult to achieve. It may require turning business away, and incurring the risk of disappointing sources of future business and upsetting customers and ambitious staff. One strategy may be to increase prices. This will have the effect of increasing the cash the business operations are generating as well as choking off some demand from customers who are unwilling to pay the higher price.
- To seek external financing, probably equity finance, as debt capacity is likely to have been reached.

Managers in successful, fast-growing businesses must look out for **signs of overtrading**. These include **cash balances trending downwards**, **payment terms to suppliers lengthening** and the **overdraft facility being used more frequently**. When the current ratio (current **assets/current liabilities**) is **less than 1, questions should be asked about the business’s ability to pay its short-term creditors**; in other words, its ability to keep going.

### External sources of finance
External sources of finance are necessary when internal ones are not enough

### Debt finance
Debt finance – borrowing the money – **allows a company to raise cash without giving away any share capital or equity**. The company can **offset interest payments against tax** (assuming it is making enough profit to incur tax), and thus there is good reason to expect debt finance to be relatively cheap.

If a business is looking for debt finance, especially when times are hard, it helps to understand how banks think, and thus avoid any unnecessary misunderstanding or disappointment. Banks lend their money in return for interest. A bank will lose a lot more if the company it has lent money to goes bust than it will earn from interest if it does well. If the company does spectacularly well, the bank will be a little better off. But it will need to earn a lot of interest from a lot of clients to recover what it has lost on a client that has gone bust, unless it can protect itself in some way.

There are **various types of debt finance**:

##### Overdrafts
Overdraft funding (sometimes known as a “revolver”) is risky for the bank and for the borrower. In any business, small or large, it should be used only to **fund short-term cash flow shortfalls** – helping to smooth out the ups and downs of the working capital cycle. An overdraft can be called in at any time, so it is a **high-risk strategy** for a business to rely on it for longer-term financing. From the bank’s point of view an overdraft is often unsecured, increasing its exposure. Even though a business pays interest on an overdraft only when it has one, interest **rates are high to reflect the risk**. **Longer-term appropriately structured debt financing is much cheaper.**

##### Loaning against assets
When structuring debt, the most common way a bank can make sure that its **position is protected** is **not through setting aggressive interest rates, but by securing its loan against assets in the business**. If the business goes under, at least the bank can lay claim to and sell the asset against which it has secured the debt. **Asset-rich businesses find it easier to borrow money**. And assets are not just bricks, mortar and machinery; intangible assets can be used as well. Raising money against trade debtors, for example, is now well established and has the added advantage of growing as the business grows (assuming the debtor book grows with the business, which is usual)

##### Cash flow lending
An established business with a good track record may be able to take advantage of so-called cash flow lending. Rather than taking security against specific assets, a bank relies on the cash flow that the business expects to generate to give it the comfort it needs. The bank will seek safeguards in the form of warranties and covenants based on such measures as profitability, enterprise value and ratios comparing profit with interest.

Enthusiasts for cash flow lending argue that it is more focused than asset-based lending on the ability of a business to repay its debts. Focusing on an assessment of future cash flows rather than assets that can be secured often increases the debt capacity of a business; it also increases the number of businesses able to raise debt finance. 
(**Debt finance** refers to the process of raising capital by borrowing money that must be repaid over time, usually with interest)

##### Corporate bonds and debentures
Big, established businesses have other debt options. A corporate bond or debenture is a longer-term debt instrument with a maturity date, a redemption value and a coupon (an interest rate, usually fixed).

##### Guarantees
Small-business owners are often asked by banks for personal guarantees that put their own (as opposed to the company’s) assets at risk if the company is unable to pay back the loan, notwithstanding the limited liability status of the company. Personal guarantee documents are long and complicated, and are designed to protect the bank’s interests. But many of those asked to give personal guarantees pay insufficient attention to protecting their own positions before signing the documentation. A business owner should resist giving a personal guarantee and, if faced with no alternative, should take independent professional advice before agreeing to one


### Equity finance
*The other principal source of finance*, for businesses of all shapes and sizes, **is equity**, referred to as share ownership in the UK and stock ownership in the US. A shareholder owns a slice of the business. The other principal source of finance, for businesses of all shapes and sizes, is equity, referred to as share ownership in the UK and stock ownership in the US. A shareholder owns a slice of the business. The share entitles its owner to a share of the future income distributed by the business in the form of dividends, or to a return of capital when the business is sold.


Once the entrepreneur’s own funds have been exhausted, new businesses often call on what cynics refer to as the “three Fs” (friends, family and fools) for initial funding.

They often take advantage of tax breaks giving exemption from capital gains when investing, in the US, in qualified small business stock. Angels in the UK can use the Enterprise Investment Scheme when investing, giving them significant income and capital gains tax benefits as long as they are qualifying individuals investing in ordinary shares in qualifying companies based in the UK.

This partly reflects the characteristics of equity finance compared with debt finance. In theory **debt finance is straightforward**. Can the company offer security? Can the business afford the interest and the repayments? If the answer to both these questions is yes, debt is relatively easy to find. **Equity financiers are not as comfortable with security**; they look instead at the robustness of the proposition, the quality of the opportunity, the return it will generate and the business’s ability to repay the investment, notwithstanding the lack of security. Such qualities are difficult to assess and the assessment process, called due diligence, takes time and costs money, which the investor must justify spending.


##### Venture capital and private equity
Institutions that invest in early-stage companies are often called venture capitalists, and a typical venture-capital investment will be for a minority stake. When investments are made in established companies, or are used to fund the acquisition of a listed business (taking a company private), the investing institution usually talks about private equity, and the investment will more often be for a majority stake. When part-financed by a significant injection of debt finance, the deal will be called “leveraged”.


### Private Equity

**Private equity** refers to investment funds, typically managed by firms or individuals, that directly invest in private companies or engage in buyouts of public companies to take them private (hence the name "private" equity). The key characteristics of private equity investments are:

- **Ownership Stakes**: Private equity investments often involve buying a significant, if not controlling, stake in a company. Unlike venture capital, which usually acquires minority stakes in early-stage companies, private equity often targets majority ownership.
    
- **Types of Companies**: While venture capital focuses on early-stage, high-growth potential startups, private equity firms typically invest in more established companies. They may seek to invest in underperforming or undervalued companies that they can turn around, streamline, or grow with the aim of selling them later for a profit.
    
- **Exit Strategies**: The goal of a private equity investment is to significantly improve a company's value over time and then exit the investment through means such as a sale to another company, a merger, or a public offering (IPO).

**Leveraged** refers to the use of borrowed money (debt) to complete an investment transaction, typically a buyout, with the primary goal of increasing the potential return of the investment. In a **leveraged buyout (LBO)**, the assets of the company being acquired and often the assets of the acquiring company are used as collateral for the loans



Even if the founders still own the majority of the shares in the business they have founded, they will have given up significant influence over their business as soon as they have said yes to external equity finance

**Obtaining a listing for the first time** is known as a **flotation** or an **initial public offering (IPO).**
Different markets in different jurisdictions have different rules and procedures for flotations and IPOs
