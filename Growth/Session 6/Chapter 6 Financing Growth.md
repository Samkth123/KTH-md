This requires skilful management of the balance sheet, making sure that cash flows through the business as efficiently as possible and that the balance sheet is not unnecessarily weighed down with assets such as trade debtors and stock or inventory, which might otherwise be converted to cash.

"**trade debtors**" refers to the amounts of money owed to a business by its customers who have purchased goods or services on credit. Essentially, these are the accounts receivable of the company. The term emphasizes that these amounts are due from business transactions or trade.

Business managers who are good at managing cash are aware of how much cash is tied up in various parts of the business and how long it sticks there; and they are good at clearing unnecessary blockages

In some businesses, such as bookshops, stock is slow-moving. In others, such as supermarkets, it moves much faster.

Businesses that pay their suppliers immediately are at a cashflow disadvantage to those that pay their creditors on terms. The longer the terms a business can negotiate with its suppliers, the longer the business can keep cash in the business, and the less it has to rely on external sources for the cash to finance the business.

Big businesses can and often do dictate payment terms to small businesses. When the recession struck, some big businesses told their customers that they expected payment within two weeks rather than 30 days. Most businesses, especially big businesses, find it easier to bully their suppliers than their customers.

Effective cost management requires a ruthless examination of the detail and an ability to distinguish the critical from the merely useful. Companies that are growing quickly are under more pressure than stable companies to protect their margins. A growing company needs to be careful with its prices. A price reduction might increase the rate of growth but put additional pressure on profit, which will be under pressure because of growth in the first place.


Big companies that want to strengthen their cash position, however, will work hard at reducing costs as well as adjusting the timing of their cash flows.

Sometimes margin and cash management pull in different directions. Offering discounts to encourage swift payment on the part of customers may speed up the flow of cash into the business significantly. But such discounting can cut heavily into margins and as with all price cuts will go straight to the bottom line

Taking advantage of a purchase discount by paying suppliers quickly may improve margins (though not as much as choosing not to offer a sales discount), but it might put pressure on a business’s cash resources as cash will have to leave the business sooner.

### Managing the investment in growth

Growth is costly. In the long term it may be the only way to secure a sustainable business, but in the short term it will cost money. A growing business must reinvest in itself and will need increasing amounts of working capital (the amount of resources tied up in the balance sheet in the cash cycle).

Many growing businesses, especially business-to-business ones with reliable customers, take advantage of asset-based finance, borrowing mainly against debtors and occasionally against inventory as well

Neil Churchill and John Mullins in a 2001 article in Harvard Business Review:
(it is possible to calculate to what extent cash constraints determined by cash flows in and out of a business will allow the business to grow):

- A business that ties up cash unnecessarily on the balance sheet in the form of excess inventory or uncollected debtors is putting itself under unnecessary cash pressure.
- A business that is paying its suppliers more quickly than necessary is putting itself under unnecessary cash pressure.
- The higher a business’s margins, the greater its cash-generating capability is likely to be.
- The faster a business grows, the more pressure it will put on its cash resources.

### Growing too fast

A business that is growing too fast is overtrading. As with many growth problems, it is ironic that the problem of overtrading is a product of success. In the simplest terms, a business that is overtrading is attempting to do too much with the cash resources at its disposal. 
(**Overtrading** refers to a situation where a business expands its operations more quickly than its financial resources can support)

**A business facing overtrading** has three options:

- To generate more cash, faster, from the business itself. This is unlikely to work. In a business that is overtrading every element is already being tested to the utmost.
- To slow growth down, which is also surprisingly difficult to achieve. It may require turning business away, and incurring the risk of disappointing sources of future business and upsetting customers and ambitious staff. One strategy may be to increase prices. This will have the effect of increasing the cash the business operations are generating as well as choking off some demand from customers who are unwilling to pay the higher price.
- To seek external financing, probably equity finance, as debt capacity is likely to have been reached.

Managers in successful, fast-growing businesses must look out for signs of overtrading. These include cash balances trending downwards, payment terms to suppliers lengthening and the overdraft facility being used more frequently. When the current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) is less than 1, questions should be asked about the business’s ability to pay its short-term creditors; in other words, its ability to keep going.

### External sources of finance
External sources of finance are necessary when internal ones are not enough

### Debt finance
Debt finance – borrowing the money – allows a company to raise cash without giving away any share capital or equity. The company can offset interest payments against tax (assuming it is making enough profit to incur tax), and thus there is good reason to expect debt finance to be relatively cheap.

If a business is looking for debt finance, especially when times are hard, it helps to understand how banks think, and thus avoid any unnecessary misunderstanding or disappointment. Banks lend their money in return for interest. A bank will lose a lot more if the company it has lent money to goes bust than it will earn from interest if it does well. If the company does spectacularly well, the bank will be a little better off. But it will need to earn a lot of interest from a lot of clients to recover what it has lost on a client that has gone bust, unless it can protect itself in some way.

There are various types of debt finance:

##### Overdrafts
Overdraft funding (sometimes known as a “revolver”) is risky for the bank and for the borrower. In any business, small or large, it should be used only to fund short-term cash flow shortfalls – helping to smooth out the ups and downs of the working capital cycle. An overdraft can be called in at any time, so it is a high-risk strategy for a business to rely on it for longer-term financing. From the bank’s point of view an overdraft is often unsecured, increasing its exposure. Even though a business pays interest on an overdraft only when it has one, interest rates are high to reflect the risk. Longer-term appropriately structured debt financing is much cheaper.
