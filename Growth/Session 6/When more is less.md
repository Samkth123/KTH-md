### Core Hypothesis

The study hypothesizes that while financial capital is crucial for early-stage ventures, an excessive amount can paradoxically lead to failure. This phenomenon is often termed as "too much of a good thing."

### Mechanisms of Capital Mobilization and Their Impact

The study identifies and contrasts two types of claims—unbounded and bounded—that entrepreneurs use to mobilize resources:

1. **Unbounded Claims**:
    
    - These are ambitious, forward-looking claims that are not necessarily backed by current realities or capabilities.
    - Entrepreneurs using unbounded claims often promise groundbreaking innovations or market-leading features to excite potential backers.
    - **Impact**: While such claims can significantly increase the amount of capital raised by drawing more attention and creating hype, they also raise expectations to a level that may not be achievable with the venture’s current technology or expertise. This mismatch can lead to failure in delivering the promised product, resulting in project collapse and loss of trust.
2. **Bounded Claims**:
    
    - These claims are more conservative and closely tied to the venture's existing capabilities and realistic projections.
    - Entrepreneurs using bounded claims focus on what is currently feasible, offering a clear and realistic view of the venture's potential to backers.
    - **Impact**: Bounded claims tend to attract less capital but set achievable expectations. This alignment between backers' expectations and venture capabilities often leads to successful product delivery and venture sustainability.

### Empirical Analysis

- **Case Studies**: The authors analyzed 22 crowdfunded drone ventures, differentiating between those that succeeded in delivering their products on time and as promised, and those that failed.
- **Findings**: Ventures that failed often used unbounded claims to attract funding. These ventures typically faced challenges such as unmanageable technological complexity and uncontrolled organizational scaling, leading to delays, budget overruns, and ultimately, failure to deliver.
- Conversely, ventures that succeeded made bounded claims, leading to better alignment between resource mobilization and operational execution.

### Consequences of Overfunding

- **Technological Overreach**: Ventures may attempt to develop technologies that are beyond their current capabilities to meet the inflated expectations set by unbounded claims.
- **Organizational Strain**: Excessive funds can lead to rapid scaling that is not sustainable, creating operational inefficiencies and diluting the venture's focus.

### Recommendations

- **For Entrepreneurs**: It is crucial to balance ambition with realism in their fundraising strategies. Making claims that are grounded in current capabilities and realistic projections can help ensure long-term success.
- **For Backers and Investors**: They should perform thorough due diligence to understand the feasibility of the claims made by entrepreneurs. This includes evaluating the technological basis of the product and the track record of the team.

### Conclusion

The study provides a nuanced view of how resource mobilization strategies impact the long-term viability of crowdfunded ventures. By illustrating the dangers of over-capitalization through unbounded claims, it advises a more measured approach to fundraising and expectation management to foster sustainable venture growth.

This detailed summary explains the mechanisms through which excessive capital can negatively impact early-stage ventures, providing insights into the strategic considerations entrepreneurs and backers must weigh in the crowdfunding context.
