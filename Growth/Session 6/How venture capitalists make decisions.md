To be sure, most of us have the broad sense that they (VCs) fill a crucial market need by **connecting entrepreneurs who have good ideas but no money** with **investors who have money but no ideas.**

The first task a VC faces is connecting with start-ups that are looking for funding—a process known in the industry as “**generating deal flow**. ”

According to our survey, more than 30% of deals come from leads from VCs’ former colleagues or work acquaintances. Other contacts also play a role: 20% of deals come from referrals by other investors, and 8% from referrals by existing portfolio companies. Only 10% result from cold email pitches by company management. But almost 30% are generated by VCs initiating contact with entrepreneurs.
