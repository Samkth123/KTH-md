To be sure, most of us have the broad sense that they (VCs) fill a crucial market need by **connecting entrepreneurs who have good ideas but no money** with **investors who have money but no ideas.**

The first task a VC faces is connecting with start-ups that are looking for funding—a process known in the industry as “**generating deal flow**. ”

According to our survey, more than 30% of deals come from leads from VCs’ former colleagues or work acquaintances. Other contacts also play a role: 20% of deals come from referrals by other investors, and 8% from referrals by existing portfolio companies. Only 10% result from cold email pitches by company management. But almost 30% are generated by VCs initiating contact with entrepreneurs.

Few VCs use standard financial-analysis techniques to assess deals. The most commonly used metric is simply the cash returned from the deal as a multiple of the cash invested.

One framework suggests that VCs favor either the “jockey” or the “horse. ” (The entrepreneurial team is the jockey, and the startup’s strategy and business model are the horse.) Our survey found that VCs believe both the jockey and the horse are necessary—but ultimately deem the founding management team to be more critical.
