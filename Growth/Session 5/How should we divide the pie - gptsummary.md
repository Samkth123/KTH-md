The document is a scholarly article from the Journal of Business Venturing, discussing the impact of equity distribution on entrepreneurial teams. Here's a summary of its key points:

**Equity Distribution and Entrepreneurial Teams**: The article presents a dynamic model based on a six-month study of eight entrepreneurial teams to understand the consequences of equity distribution among team members. A crucial finding is that the perceived justice of equity distribution significantly influences team interactions and outcomes.

**Perceived Justice as a Key Variable**: High perceived justice in equity distribution leads to positive team interaction spirals, marked by strong team unity and a decrease in team discord. Conversely, low perceived justice results in negative interaction spirals, characterized by increasing team discord and decreasing team unity.

**Impact of External Threats**: Teams facing external threats, such as investor pressure, can shift from positive to negative interaction spirals despite initially high perceived justice. This shift highlights the fragile nature of team dynamics under external stress.

**Consequences for Team and Venture Performance**: The study connects the team interaction spirals with entrepreneurial outcomes. Positive spirals are associated with stable teams and high performance, while negative spirals often lead to team member exits and lower performance levels.

**Insights and Contributions**: The research offers insights into the effects of equity distribution decisions made during a venture's foundation on its long-term development. It contributes to theories on entrepreneurial imprinting, distributive justice, and entrepreneurial exit by showing how equity distribution impacts team dynamics and outcomes.

Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of perceived fairness in equity distribution within entrepreneurial teams, highlighting its significant impact on team interactions, stability, and performance.
