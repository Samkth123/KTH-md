Agenda today:
1. The ENT team life cycle
2. ENT team dynamics: the quantitive side
3. ENT team dynamics: the qualitative side

1. Empirical papers - papers that use data
Qualitative papers: papers that use qualitative methods (often interviews) often useful to understand in depth processes
Regular quantitive papers: papers that tet hypothesis/relationships with statistical analyses
meta-analytic papers: papers that aggregate results from prior quantitive papers

2. Non-empirical papers
Conceptual papers: papers that develop new theory, normally without testing it empirically
Review papers: papers that summarise and interpret prior research on a specific topic
