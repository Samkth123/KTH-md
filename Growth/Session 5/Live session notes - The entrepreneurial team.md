Agenda today:
1. The ENT team life cycle
2. ENT team dynamics: the quantitive side
3. ENT team dynamics: the qualitative side

#### Types of academic papers
1. Empirical papers - papers that use data
Qualitative papers: papers that use qualitative methods (often interviews) often useful to understand in depth processes
Regular quantitive papers: papers that tet hypothesis/relationships with statistical analyses
meta-analytic papers: papers that aggregate results from prior quantitive papers

2. Non-empirical papers
Conceptual papers: papers that develop new theory, normally without testing it empirically
Review papers: papers that summarise and interpret prior research on a specific topic


### The ENT team life cycle

- review article with some conceptual article elements
- Key insights
	- Lifecycle perspective on ENT teams: formation, collaboration and dissolution
	- The team does not have to go through all phases, and the process is not linear (teams can go back to a prior stage)
	- Complete dissolution is normally a longterm process (unless the firm goes bankrupt and all members exit or if someone buys the firm and wants a completely new managerial team)

##### The doulbe life cycle model
- development of the life cycke of the team with the lifecycle of the firm
- The ENT team life cycle is **independent** but **embedded** in the lifecycle of the firm
- Research shows that many teams rarely survive in the initial composition of when they started the company


### QUANT SIDE:

#### ENT TEAM DYNAMICS: THE SET UP
Type of paper: quantitive paper
Research question: How does quity split among start up co founders change over time?

Key insights:
- Teams that start with an equal
