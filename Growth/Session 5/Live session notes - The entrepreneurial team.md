Agenda today:
1. The ENT team life cycle
2. ENT team dynamics: the quantitive side
3. ENT team dynamics: the qualitative side

#### Types of academic papers
1. Empirical papers - papers that use data
Qualitative papers: papers that use qualitative methods (often interviews) often useful to understand in depth processes
Regular quantitive papers: papers that tet hypothesis/relationships with statistical analyses
meta-analytic papers: papers that aggregate results from prior quantitive papers

2. Non-empirical papers
Conceptual papers: papers that develop new theory, normally without testing it empirically
Review papers: papers that summarise and interpret prior research on a specific topic


### The ENT team life cycle

- review article with some conceptual article elements
- Key insights
	- Lifecycle perspective on ENT teams: formation, collaboration and dissolution
	- The team does not have to go through all phases, and the process is not linear (teams can go back to a prior stage)
	- Complete dissolution is normally a longterm process (unless the firm goes bankrupt and all members exit or if someone buys the firm and wants a completely new managerial team)

##### The doulbe life cycle model
- development of the life cycke of the team with the lifecycle of the firm
- The ENT team life cycle is **independent** but **embedded** in the lifecycle of the firm
- Research shows that many teams rarely survive in the initial composition of when they started the company


### QUANT SIDE:

#### ENT TEAM DYNAMICS: THE SET UP
Type of paper: quantitive paper
Research question: How does equity split among start up co founders change over time?

Key insights:
- Teams that start with an equal split (fairness logic) are less likely to change it over time
- Equal splitters have fewer investment rounds, are less likely to attract VC money, and have lower premoney valuations. Close to equal spitters behave differently. (extra note: VC capital is often for startups that want to grow at a fast rate)
- Trigger: a new financing round provides opportunities for recalibration. Relative founder stakes are more likely to change when a company raises investments.
- Magnitude: larger rounds and lower valuations are associated with bigger changes in relative founder stakes
- Why would a larger round of investment make a change of equity distribution more likely? (ex 2 companies of same size but different size investments) (Large money raised, but lower valuations - this makes a change in equity split more likely - why?)
	- Investors do not have a lot of reason to be driven by fairness but rather efficiency. So equity is driven by what you can bring to the table

Discussion:
Equal split start seems to stay that way in the future as well
- being fair becomes effective because all want
- but fair and equal does not need to be the same
- need to reward contributions to the company with equity
	- good way to get even more contributions in the future
- Investors can easier break up founding partners with less fair share
- Most VCs want cofounder teams to succeed, reasons for investors aversions to equal splitters because they are scared that the cofounders are hesitant to talk about difficult topics like equity distribution (because 50-50 could be not representative of the true distribution of workload) they will be scared of other things as well. Also that it might just be that the starters wanted a "partner in crime" and just wanted to have fun. More like the entrepreneurs might have not started this to become an unicorn.

- equal split benefit is that the cofounders become equally committed to the venture

### QUAL SIDE: ENT TEAM DYNAMICS
#### How should we divide the pie: THE SET UP

typ case studies
interviews tracking ket events for periods after as well in this paper

Purposeful sample: startups still managed by the founding team, located in business incubators in europ, some with equal, some with unequal equity distribution among the members of the entrepreneurial team, only startups with exactly 2 cofounders
THeory employed: (percieved) justice in organizational contexts
Research question: how does the equity distribution in the entrepreneurial team shapes interactions among its members over time

Key insights:
- a key antecedent of **perceived justice of equity distribution** was **equal** **equity distribution** 5050
- When **perceived justice of equity distribution** matched the cofounders percieved **past and present octnbutions** to the startup, an unequal split was also perceived as just
- high/low perceived justice ofequity distribution trigger **high/low team attraction** (intra team trust and team cohesion) and **low/high team repulsion** (relationship conflict and social distancing)
- when the negative interaction spirals start, they further reduce the perceived justice of equity distribution and sometimes lead to cofunder exit
- the positive/negative team interaction spirals positively/negatively affect team and firm performance
- "injustice is like a corrosive solvent that can dissolve bonds within the community"

practical recommendations for equity distributoins:
- what may feel like a just/unjust. equity distrubtion to you mat not appear so to your coufner
	- make sure your coufunder sees the equity distriuon as fiar to avoid trouble later. If someone accepts a deal it does not automatically mean heshe is happy with it
	- if your cofouinder proposes a deal that you see as unjust voice your concerns
- when you discuss contributions to the venture, consider also future conrtibution not only past and present ones
- think about whether contingency contract would be useful, or at least have a discution about contigencies
	- what happens if one cofounder wants to diminish hisher work contribution, to engage in antoher entrpeenerual project or employment
	- what happens with the equity if one cofounder decides to leave
	- how will you evaluate the company for a cofounder exit
