Equity, often referred to as shareholders' equity or owners' equity, represents the amount of money that would be returned to shareholders if all of the assets of a company were liquidated and all of its debts were paid off. It reflects the residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting all its liabilities. In simpler terms, it's what the shareholders own outright in the company.


### Short-term Liabilities

These are obligations that a company is expected to pay within one fiscal year. They include accounts payable, wages, taxes due, and other similar debts. Including short-term liabilities in your calculations gives a snapshot of the company's financial obligations that need to be met in the near term.

### Long-term Liabilities

These are obligations that extend beyond one year. Examples include long-term loans, bonds payable, deferred tax liabilities, and lease obligations. These reflect the company's longer-term financial commitments and give insight into its future debt service obligations.
