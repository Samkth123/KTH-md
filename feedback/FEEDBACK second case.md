**FEEDBACK second case**

  

**Element Mobile expands into refurbished phones (MBB 2nd round)  FEEDBACK**

  

Good at asking calrifying questions

  

Also good that took time to come up with structure

  

**Thing to get better at:**

3rd question calculations:

- 400k customers
- Just dont say answer, but say what does it mean for the customer 
- Wanted that we go back to information in the beginning and say that theese new numbers were 2% of our total customers 
- always put numbers in relation to other things

  

In recommendation need to (what advice client). (Also need to be structured here)

1. Give yes or no and reasoning
2. Give risks
3. Say next steps

  

^^Kanske hade vart bra att från början notera vad som kan vara viktigt i slutet.
