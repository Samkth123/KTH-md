Goal - align expectations, understand how course works, osv...

CI - You do something for every single commit (automated)
- What do you want to do with this commit?
	- In CI you want to check things, ex check if formating is correct (you used tabs instead of space for example) Then it fails
	- But formating is checked before you even push? Ex write a script that checks

devops - development operations -- means not writing code but running code.

==**GitHub Actions**== is **a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline**. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

**==Git hooks==**  are **scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository**. They let you customize Git's internal behavior and trigger customizable actions at key points in the development life cycle.

First step of CI workflow is run all tests.

==If you have repos where you dont have CI included you need to active them till next week==

Testing is dynamic

Static testing can be checked if all functions are documented, if your methods are not documented CI should not allow to push
