Goal - align expectations, understand how course works, osv...

CI - You do something for every single commit (automated)
- What do you want to do with this commit?
	- In CI you want to check things, ex check if formating is correct (you used tabs instead of space for example) Then it fails
	- But formating is checked before you even push? Ex write a script that checks

devops - development operations -- means not writing code but running code.

==**GitHub Actions**== is **a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline**. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

**==Git hooks==**  are **scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository**. They let you customize Git's internal behavior and trigger customizable actions at key points in the development life cycle.

First step of CI workflow is run all tests.

==If you have repos where you dont have CI included you need to active them till next week==

Testing is dynamic

Static testing can be checked if all functions are documented, if your methods are not documented CI should not allow to push

**Spoon** is best code analysis for java

Aman gillar att automate fråga han om något

interact with TA's on github

labsessions are inperson support sessions and are optional
- TAs tell you about expectations and if what you have is good enough
- verkar vara väldigt bra att gå på

devops is the principle that development and operations should be integrated, so put them together with lots of automation.

CD-continious development

**THIS IS CD - Continuous deployment??** inte development?
Once code is merged, there is another CD process that will push it to production in a automated way

Code review and CI is bare minimum om ska jobba med software

what is CI, what is hard in CI... FÖR PRESENTATIONEN/DEMO

week is only for synchronous tasks

failing demos är enkla saker - ska vara really hard, took real time to understand and to do, things might fail but if you can explain why its ok and you pass.

måste vara väldigt teknisk annars fail

1 slide reflection

once sentence take home message

demo:
mother of demos - 1967

demo ska vara visually appealing så kanske kan göra någon frontend på det




How normal to fail task? fråga TA
master thesis?
When programmable society?
research in software, how much theory is it and how much is implementation?

git cry
memes



devops - always dependencies up to date for security - and should be done by dependency bots
