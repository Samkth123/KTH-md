Goal - align expectations, understand how course works, osv...

CI - You do something for every single commit (automated)
- What do you want to do with this commit?
	- In CI you want to check things, ex check if formating is correct (you used tabs instead of space for example) Then it fails
	- But formating is checked before you even push? Ex write a script that checks

devops - development operations -- means not writing code but running code.
