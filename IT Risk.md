Nist cybersecurity framework:


Hey, thank u! I did have a case interview. Itâ€™s not as daunting as it sounds. For my case, they essentially give me a few pages to read. The case company had a few problems and I had to come up with solutions on how I would tackle them. The interviewer just wants to know how you think/logic. So be sure to explain like
1. The problem e.g. the company is scaling and needs better centralization
2. How you would solve it e.g. you want to implement a software
3. (Arguably most important imo) say how you would implement it. E.g. pilot roll out in a department first to fix issues then expand.
