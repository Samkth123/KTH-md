Nist cybersecurity framework:
- organise and prioritize what actions to take to reduce cyber secuirity risks and manage risks that might still be present


Hey, thank u! I did have a case interview. It’s not as daunting as it sounds. For my case, they essentially give me a few pages to read. The case company had a few problems and I had to come up with solutions on how I would tackle them. The interviewer just wants to know how you think/logic. So be sure to explain like
1. The problem e.g. the company is scaling and needs better centralization
2. How you would solve it e.g. you want to implement a software
3. (Arguably most important imo) say how you would implement it. E.g. pilot roll out in a department first to fix issues then expand.

### Public Cloud

- **Definition**: Services offered over the public internet, shared across multiple organizations.
- **Examples**: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.
- **Cost**: Pay-as-you-go pricing model, generally lower costs due to shared resources.
- **Scalability**: Highly scalable; resources can be provisioned on demand.
- **Security**: Security managed by the provider; might not meet specific regulatory requirements for sensitive data.
- **Use Cases**: Best for non-sensitive data, web applications, and startups needing flexibility.

### Private Cloud

- **Definition**: Exclusive cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization.
- **Examples**: On-premises servers, hosted private cloud services.
- **Cost**: Higher upfront costs due to dedicated infrastructure; ongoing maintenance required.
- **Scalability**: Limited compared to public cloud; requires additional resources to scale.
- **Security**: Enhanced security and control, often compliant with regulatory requirements.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for businesses with strict security needs, such as finance and healthcare.

### Hybrid Cloud

- **Definition**: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
- **Examples**: Utilizing public cloud services for less sensitive operations while keeping critical data in a private cloud.
- **Cost**: Balances costs; can be cost-effective but may require investment in both environments.
- **Scalability**: Flexible scalability; can expand in the public cloud while keeping sensitive operations private.
- **Security**: Offers a balance of security and flexibility; sensitive data can remain secure while benefiting from the public cloud’s scalability.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for organizations with fluctuating workloads or those needing to meet compliance requirements while still utilizing public resources.

### Summary

- **Public Cloud**: Cost-effective and scalable but less secure.
- **Private Cloud**: More secure and controlled but at a higher cost.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Flexible, allowing a mix of both, catering to various needs and workloads.
