### Maths


### Division
##### **==The magic "10" crutch technique==**

The “10” crutch rule: finally, there is one last handy dividing trick related to the number 10. If you need to divide something by 5, you can use division by 10 as a crutch. Instead of dividing directly by 5, divide the number by 10, then multiply times 2.

For example, 5,890 / 5 can be converted into (5,890 / 10) * 2. So in this case, 589 * 2 = 1,178.

**==TÄNK PÅ ATT DET ÄR /10 SEN x2 inte /2!!!==**

##### **==Simplifying with subtraction==**
If you’ve got a messy division problem, you can also break apart the dividend into two components which when subtracted from each equal the original dividend and are more easily divided by the divisor. Then, divide each by the divisor and subtract them.

For example, take 740 / 5. At first glance, this might seem messy to solve but if you can break it up into (800 - 60) / 5, which is the same as (800 / 5) - (60 / 5), the problem becomes easier. Solve each separately, (800 / 5) = 160 and (60 / 5) = 12. Then subtract them, 160 - 12 = 148.

**Technique recap**

- Break apart the dividend
- Solve for each component
- Subtract the results

##### Division: Simplifying with addition
If you’ve got a messy division problem, you can break apart the dividend into two components which add together to the original dividend. Then, again, you can divide each by the divisor and add them together.

For example, take 11,124 / 3. You can first split the dividend into (11,100 + 24) / 3. This helps since 24 / 3 is 8, but the first part is still messy. Re-apply the rule so you get (9,000 + 2,100 + 24) / 3. Now you’ve got numbers easily divisible by three throughout the dividend: (9,000 / 3) + (2,100 / 3) + (24/3) = 3,000 + 700 + 8, so the answer is 3,708!

**Technique recap**

- Break apart the dividend
- Solve for each component
- Add the results

##### Division: Magic of factoring

This is the key to simplifying a lot of messy division problems and you can use it on the numerator or denominator. You can factor the numerator, the denominator or both!

Factoring the numerator: If you’ve got a messy problem like 500 / 4, you could factor this into 5 * (100 / 4) and solve. (100 / 4 ) = 25, so 5 * 25 = 125.

Factoring the denominator: Take the problem 500 / 4 again. ==Another approach is to attack the denominator and say dividing by 4 is really like dividing by 2 twice (eg dividing by 2 and then immediately dividing by 2 again).== So 500 / 4 is really 500 / 2 / 2 or 500 / 2 = 250 and 250 / 2 = 125.

Factoring both: Take the problem 210 / 42. This can be factored into (30 * 7) / (6 * 7). The 7s will cancel out leaving you with 30 / 6, so the answer is 5.

**Technique recap**

- Factor the dividend and divider
- Identify canceling numbers
- Divide remaining numbers

##### ==Division: Handy fractions and rules==

Walking through some of the common fractions can be helpful to anchor yourself because those ratios will pop up as you're working through division problems.

- 1/2 is 0.5
- 1/3 is ~0.33 (repeating)
- 1/4 is 0.25
- 1/5 is 0.20
- 1/6 is ~0.16 (repeating)
- 1/7 is ~0.14
- 1/8 is 0.125
- 1/9 is ~0.11 (repeating)

Här blir det enkelt, ex 729/8 = 720/8 är 90 + 9/8 vilket är 1/8 + 1 å vi vet av minne att 1/8 är 0,125

**Quick divisibility rules**

In a similar vein, there are a handful of key divisibility rules you can keep in mind.

- 2 if ends in 0,2,4,6,8,10
- 3 if digits sum to multiple of 3
- 4 if last two digits are divisible by 4
- 5 if last digit is 0 or 5
- 6 if divisible by 2 and 3
- 8 if last 3 digits are divisible by 8 or by 2 3 times
- 9 if digits sum to multiple of 9


### Multiplication

##### Multiplication: Handling zeroes

Multiplying smaller numbers: One way to simplify the madness of keeping track of zeroes is to simply count the zeros, assign it a multiplier, do the non-zero math and then remember to multiply that answer times the multiplier you stored a second earlier.

For example, take the problem 250 * 400. Start by counting and then removing the zeros. There are three zeros, so you should remove them and make a mental note that your answer must be multiplied by a zeroes placeholder. In this case, that zeroes placeholder is 1,000, to account for those three zeros. So now you’ve got (25 * 4) * 1,000, which equates to 100 * 1,000, which is 100,000.

##### ==Handling loooots of zeros==

Multiply 45,000 by 600,000
- 45k x 600k 
- 45k x 6k x 100
- 45x2x3 = 90x3 = 270
- 270 x k x k x 100 = 27000000000 = 27B

##### ==Multiplication: Techniques for multiplying by 5 and 25==

Multiplying by 5: Multiply by 10 and then divide the result by 2. This can simplify multiplication problems where 5 is the multiplier.

For example: Take the problem, 6,400 * 5. You can translate that to (6,400 * 10) / 2, and that’s a much easier problem to solve. As 64,000 / 2 = 32,000. 

Multiplying by 25: Multiply by 100 and then divide the result by 4. Again, this can help simplify things when 25 is the multiplier.

==**For example**==: Take the problem 2,420 * 25. You can translate this into (2,420 * 100) / 4. So now you’ve got 242,000 / 4. This might seem daunting but if you re-use what you learned in division you know you can factor this to (242 * 1,000) / 4, which would be (242 / 4) * 1,000. Again, from earlier you know that 242 / 4 can be simplified to 242 / 2 / 2 so 121 / 2 = 60.5 and 60.5 * 1,000 = 60,500.

##### ==Multiplication: Dealing with messy multipliers==

The distributive law is your friend. Multiplying messy numbers can be simplified by breaking down the problem using the distributive law and addition.

For example, if the problem is 530 x 200, you can break this down into (500 + 30) * 200, which is a much easier problem. Now you’ve got (500 * 200) + (30 * 200) as the problem. You can use the small multiplication techniques to get 100,000 for the first term and 6,000 for the second term, so add them together for the answer which is 106,000.


### Breakevens

##### Breakevens: Dealing with messy, large numbers

One more example: Say the upfront cost to train personnel and create a new servicing unit for the enterprise arm of a large Canadian telecoms company is $90,000,000, service cost is $63,000 and expected service price is $90,000.

How many service installations do they need to breakeven? Setup the formula first: $90,000,000 = ($90,000 - $63,000) * units. Here, given the large numbers, it makes sense to use placeholders to simplify, so you can re-write the equation: $90M = ($90K - $63K) * units. Now, calculate unit margin so you’ve got $90M = $27K * units.

Now solve the algebraic equation for units. To make it easier, try factoring M into K * K (see placeholder above if forgot this). So now you’ve got: $90 * K * K / $27 * K.

You can cancel out a single K on top and bottom, leaving you with ($90 / $27) * K. $90 / $27 reduces to 10 / 3, if you divide each by 9. So now you’ve got 10/3 or 3.333 * K, so the answer is 3,333.

### Growth
If growth over 2 years, and small growth rate, can understand that 10% over two years is 1.1x1.1 =1.21 but also can be seen as 1.1+1.1 = 1.2 which is almost same
