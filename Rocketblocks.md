### Maths

**The magic "10" crutch technique**

The “10” crutch rule: finally, there is one last handy dividing trick related to the number 10. If you need to divide something by 5, you can use division by 10 as a crutch. Instead of dividing directly by 5, divide the number by 10, then multiply times 2.

For example, 5,890 / 5 can be converted into (5,890 / 10) * 2. So in this case, 589 * 2 = 1,178.

**==TÄNK PÅ ATT DET ÄR /10 SEN x2 inte /2!!!==**
