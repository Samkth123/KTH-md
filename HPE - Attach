## Overall summaries
 As a very minimum support service for customers we position the HPE Tech Care service, this is different from warranty and has predefined reactive SLA’s and a selection of other deliverables that customers can use to empower themselves to expand their product knowledge and help in the repair process.

 Moving to an experienced based support ethos we help customers optimize their environment by introducing Complete Care which includes aligned HPE resources and proactive activities to help customers minimize unplanned downtime and use a solution block approach to include specialist elements that are technology or application specific.

 To enhance the customer experience we can support hardware of non HPE manufacture, this is known as Multivendor which makes the provision of support easy by giving customers a single source support solution for their entire IT environment.
 
#### HELP YOUR CUSTOMER PROTECT THEIR BUSINESS

 Paid HPE Operational Services is a customer-centric service experience that helps your customer protect their business.

 Warranty alone may leave a customer with unexpected costs and the possibility of prolonged downtime. When talking to customers use these questions to determine if warranty alone will help them achieve their business goals and to help you qualify the type of support services that might be the best fit.

 First, establish how important the technology will be to the business and ask the customer about the cost of unplanned downtime.

 **How fast do you need to solve issues?**

 For most organizations, minimizing unplanned downtime is an important goal. How long could your customer afford to be without their system? Paid HPE Operational Services gives customers the ability to log a call and receive remote technical assistance on a 24x7x365 basis. In addition, we can offer a 6-hour call-to-repair time.

 Next, ask questions to help you understand if what kind of support experience your customer is looking for.

 **Do you want to handle repairs yourself?**

 With paid HPE Operational Services, parts are stocked at local hubs to ensure quick replacement, and customers can request that a certified engineer install replacement parts onsite. Customers can retain defective media instead of being charged for replacement parts that are not returned within 90 days if they choose the appropriate service add on.

 **Are the components covered by the same warranty?** 

 Different components within products may have different warranty levels and durations  . With paid HPE Operational Services the entire device is covered at the same level and duration resolving any mixed warranty issues or charges for options that are out of warranty.

 **What about software?**

 HPE software warranty is limited to 90 days and only provides replacement for defective software media. With paid HPE Operational Services customers are entitled to unlimited technical software support and updates along with collaborative support for third-party software they have under contract with other vendors.
## HPE Services Value Propositions

### HPE Complete Care Services

Steg 3 av the ladder, där Warranty och HPE Tech Care Service ligger innan.

You have an assigned Account Team will work with you to help keep your IT optimized,
reduce risk, and free up time for you to innovate.

With the inclusion of modular solution blocks that incorporate IT operations management, IT
sustainability and performance/health optimization, the HPE Complete Care Service really
does offer a complete solution that goes beyond break/fix support by providing access to
experts and an enhanced digital experience, allowing you to focus on delivering an
exceptional experience to your customers.

#### HPE complete care Brochure 
HPE Complete Care Service makes sure that time spent on IT is time well spent. We’ve been helping businesses save time on reliability and management tasks for many years, but it’s no longer enough to keep them competitive.For our customers to stay ahead, we must work harder to tailor our services to their needs and their specific IT environments. We need to optimize and improve every aspect of their IT and work with them to define and meet profitable business outcomes.

No two businesses are the same, so why would we treat their IT environments the same? IT services shouldn’t be “one size fits all.”

The HPE Complete Care Service experience starts by assigning a team of experts to your account. They will help define your business IT goals and support your journey towards, optimized IT.

##### Your assigned team 
As an HPE Complete Care Service customer, you will be assigned a team — they are your first point of contact, combining their expert knowledge with a deep understanding of your IT and your business goals.

The core team will consist of an Account Support Manager who is responsible for managing your service experience from start to finish. They are your gateway to accessing specialist resources and best practice advice.

Your Technical Account Manager will supply the technical expertise for your specific environment and deliver remote guidance.

For the management and delivery of hardware support, your team will include a dedicated Assigned Customer Engineer.

In addition to your assigned core team, you can customize your experience with additional on-demand specialist

##### Optimize your IT (IMPORTANT NOTE)

==**Samma tänk som management konsulter - HPE har haft så många liknande kunder som er som har Complete Care, och därför kan man optimera så mycket som möjligt.**==

**Exempelvis hade ni velat byta till Azure från AWS hade ni inte bett era ingenjörer sitta och bygga upp från scratch, för det finns redan massa att göra för dom på ert företag, exempelvis behövs det fortfarande att man maintainar AWS tjänsten ni redan har. Ni kommer istället att hämta in IT- Konsulter som löser detta åt er, för att sedan när Azure är uppe långsamt träna era egna ingenjörer till att byta.**

The HPE personalized approach means we develop a deep understanding of our customer’s entire IT environment — not just our own hardware. We see how the infrastructure works together — from edge to cloud — and how it relates to our customer’s business aims.

When we combine this rich customer knowledge with the expertise of HPE technicians, we’re in a unique position to identify opportunities to optimize and streamline processes. We can identify inefficiencies and skills gaps and provide the means to overcome them in a cost-effective way

As we discuss our customer’s long-term business goals, our understanding of their existing IT means we can advise them on the best future solutions to achieve their goals, including steps they can take right now to prepare for the transition

This is what we mean when say we can optimize your time, your tech, and your decision-making. Consider us a trusted advisor, with you for the journey toward better optimized IT.
