### Family Constitution and Engagement

- The family has worked with the Swiss IMD business school to develop a "family constitution." This document likely outlines the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of family members involved in the company. It's a tool to manage expectations and guide the family's involvement in the business.
- Engagement with the company is encouraged from a young age, with efforts made to familiarize each generation with Lego's values, challenges, and the specifics of running a family-owned business.

### Role of the "Most Active Owner"

- Within the family, certain members are designated as more actively involved in the management and strategic direction of the company. Thomas, representing the fourth generation, has taken on significant roles, including chair of Lego and Kirkbi (the family investment vehicle), and the Lego Foundation.
- This designation helps streamline decision-making and ensures a clear line of leadership and responsibility within the family.

### The Lego School

- The Lego School is specifically mentioned as a means to inculcate future generations with the company's values and the challenges of running a family business. The school is designed to be engaging and fun, making it an attractive way for younger family members to learn about the business.
- It's part of a long-term strategy to prepare them for potentially taking on active roles in the company or as knowledgeable shareholders.

### Succession Planning

- Succession planning is taken very seriously, with structures in place to avoid the common pitfalls that can afflict family-owned businesses, such as disagreements over the direction of the company or management decisions.
- The transition from Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen to his son Thomas exemplifies a deliberate and planned succession process, ensuring stability and continuity for the company.

### Investment in Education Beyond Lego

- Beyond preparing their own family members for roles within Lego, there's an emphasis on education as a broader tool for engagement and impact. Kirkbi's investment in a digital learning platform in the US indicates a desire to reach children and have a positive impact beyond just selling Lego sets.
