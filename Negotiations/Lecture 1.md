#### Definition of negotiation

**Eget diskussion:**
metaforer: Game theory but more qualitative 
or like when you were younger and negotiated with a younger sibling that would be the ideal negotiation for you, because you give them like a scoop of pink icecream and say that its worth 10 scoops of vanila icecream.

**lecture notes**
Process of creating agreement

Three key words:
process - important because common pitfall in negotiation is that you go into negotiation with a target and intended outcome, but other party has its own intended outcome that could be very different. If both parties are very outcome oriented and not process oriented we could get stuck. But if we know that we might have to give up some stuff then we will do better. If we get stuck can we do something to get unstuck? Usually people go into negotiation very hardcore and try to get something which is not good.

agreement - important because dels legality. If one gives an offer and other says yes, then its a legally binding agreement. But behaviourly, we can have a asymmetric negotiation. If i know you have no money or put gun on table, we can get a lot of leverage or stress. If i know you have no money i can force you to take this deal. But if there is no psychological agreement (someone bullied) and the person does not feel good after the deal, then there is no psychological agreement. If there is no psychological agreement, the party that feels cheated will try to somehow get back at the person cheating them. We would want a win win situation. We really want both parties to be in psychological agreement. If someone forced into it then it will not be good.
