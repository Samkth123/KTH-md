#### Definition of negotiation

**Eget diskussion:**
metaforer: Game theory but more qualitative 
or like when you were younger and negotiated with a younger sibling that would be the ideal negotiation for you, because you give them like a scoop of pink icecream and say that its worth 10 scoops of vanila icecream.

**lecture notes**
Process of creating agreement

**Three key words:**
**process** - important because common pitfall in negotiation is that you go into negotiation with a target and intended outcome, but other party has its own intended outcome that could be very different. If both parties are very outcome oriented and not process oriented we could get stuck. But if we know that we might have to give up some stuff then we will do better. If we get stuck can we do something to get unstuck? Usually people go into negotiation very hardcore and try to get something which is not good.

**agreement** - important because dels legality. If one gives an offer and other says yes, then its a legally binding agreement. But behaviourly, we can have a asymmetric negotiation. If i know you have no money or put gun on table, we can get a lot of leverage or stress. If i know you have no money i can force you to take this deal. But if there is no psychological agreement (someone bullied) and the person does not feel good after the deal, then there is no psychological agreement. If there is no psychological agreement, the party that feels cheated will try to somehow get back at the person cheating them. We would want a win win situation. We really want both parties to be in psychological agreement. If someone forced into it then it will not be good. This is the difference between sales theory and negotiation. In sales, agreement is the end goal, but in negotiations in the agreement is where it begins, example building a company together for 5 years or cooperating for 5 years. We will be dependent on the person on the other side of the company.

**creating** - Not finding an agreement, but rather creating. In a lot of business negotiations there are numbers, and gut feeling is there is a right price or right number or right valuation osv... This is not always the case especially with startups. In longer processes everyone can be happy during the negotiations but afterwards someone might still not be happy.
Ex goldplatting, run tough negotiation but at the end give up a lot of fancy stuff to make the other part happy at the end after they got the deal (some indian outsourcing company did this.)


fortsättning:
**The process of creating agreement between two or more parties**

The more parties at the table, the more complex. Also the dynamics change when there are more countries. ex european union. Could also be negotiation teams, for example tech persons can agree in a company agreement but maybe not marketing and finance. This is in team party negotiations.


Three party negotiation

Life isnt fair - you get what you negotiate

**What you are negotiating about (frame) is more important than where you are negotiating from (power)**

A was the strongest C weakest, B middle.

A type solution - power, profit, 

C type - discussion tends to be more on fairness, win-win, more relationship oriented, future oriented

Pascal var gambler

Game theory alla matematiker var gamblers

Prisoners dilemma - 2 prisoners
- dilemma boils down to trust
- basically om gola elr inte

^^
Two countries made peace agreement
Hitler and Stalin agreed to not attack eachother, but turned around to attack eachother
ex if they dont have weapons now but get it later they might do something so lets attack them

USA, Kina, Ryssland är som A
Mindre länder är som C

Prisoners dilemma and two countries have to do with negotiations in the way that: 

Everytime banks cheat and manipulate prices together, its always one company being the whistleblower.


#### Behavioral implications for negatiators
basic game theory says:


1. Be **forthcoming** (start positively)
2. Be **provocable** (use sanctions if necessarry)
	1. if other party is cheating or tough bargain then do something to show its not ok
	2. However, this one is a bit dangerous as you have to do something that is hostile which can lead to escalation if both start doing it
	3. Example companies go into price war and lower prices until one crashes
3. Be **forgiving** (avoid long-term retribution)
4. Be **clear** (communicate)
	1. if one wants a win win deal one should communicate that
		1. this could also be used for bluffing and cheating hehe

Trust in negotiation terms often has to do with negative consequences

In business, hockey players that fight star players are often lawfirms.
Public prequorment are not good at putting in negative consequences in their contracts, so if government says "thats not ok", nothing happens. Example nya karolinska. There are never any negative consequences in the contracts with governments.
Even gangs have negative consequences built in their culture, ex talking to police

**So basically dont pick fights as are there any negative consequences of not sticking to a deal? If there are not then the other party will not stick to the deal either.**

Peace negiotations are often not because different parties like eachother or trust eachother, but trust in negotiations are often that they know that if the other party breaks the deal something bad will happen to them and they trust that the other country will not break it because they dont want negative consequences.
