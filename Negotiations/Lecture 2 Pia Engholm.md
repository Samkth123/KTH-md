How does a VC work?

Limited partners invest in funds (LPs could be people fmaily offices osv)
You need to pay management fee to fund.
When made money in fund by selling profits and stuff, the profit is split (carry) between LPs and management company
The profit is paid up to the holding company

Difference between angel fund and vc is that angel fund/network are unofficial, they dont have management fee and stuff. They dont invest someone elses money they invest their own money

In DHS 25 angels have invested there. Individuals invest their own money and the part you get from the fund is your own moeny? Usually if my copartners invested i will help them because i have an indirect interest in the company going good. 

If you have an organisation with not very strict rules then it will go away especially since interest will start to fade.


#### An entrepreneurial skillset

Sales, sales, sales
- many people dont like sales
- Every person in founding team must be able to sell
- Not only to customers, but to potential talent and investors

Recruit top talent and build high performing teams
- Will the people pitching be able to build a high performing team?

Read, write and negotiate contracts



### Negotiating with:
- cofounders and investors (termsheet/SHA)
- Employees (employment contracts)
- Customers (customer contract, saas(consiulting(product)))
- distributors
- exit or merger

**Negotiating the SHA with co-founders (share holder agreement)**
- Viktigt, you will always fight
- One person will always not like the decisions taken
- Sign SHA when you are at founding stage
- 2 importnat things
- Vesting: Your shares wont vest until you work for 4 years: so work 1 year u get 25%, 2 year next 25% osv... Normally 3-5 Ã¥r
	- Nobody wants a broken captable
	- You do not want a former founder with large amount of shares not active in the company
	- Want mechanisms in contract ex bad leaver or good leaver clauses
	- ==startuptools.org for templates==
	- shareholder agreement if very important because investors want it to be good as well

**Negotiating the SHA with angels:**

3 Fs before angel investors: Friends, Family, Fools

Angels dont want special treatment or for anything like minority investor protection

VCs want to find starts and just make them succeed, they dont care about the other companies
- They would rather not spend time on worse companies
Angels will work really hard to make their company succeed, when they are on your side they really are on your side

**Negotiating with VCs**

Not easy
Some VCs are good, some are bad
Their business model is to find the unicorns and really spend their time and money with the unicorns
Some of the VCs are happy with just a 3-4x return
Could be one person in the VC that is really good which you want to work with which will put time for you

Pia:
- Try to create stronger position
- If we cant agree i dont need you
- Make your position stronger than it is even though it might not be
- Think about the details of the contract
- Dont want a owner with too much power or be careful when someone starts acquiring shares

Recognize and be away of and try to avoid dirty terms from VCs:
- VCs often asks for preferential shares (whenever sale of company they get their money first, thye hsould get money before founders)
	- So if you ahve pref shares in A,B and C round it gets really complicated and it will block stuff when things go bad

Dont tell investors different stories they know eachother
Find an ally, if one VC accepts a term the others will accept it as well

Big difference between swedish and anglosaxan VCs - English and US VCs are much meaner and tougher. Swedish VCs are much nicer.

#### Negotiating with employees
Have NDA
Have in contract that anything an employee does belongs to you
First 10 employees are more founders than employees
When first "real" employee comes it is differnet because before everyone is sleeping and living your company, but now someone comes and does not feel like a owner of the company in the same way others do. 
When you give employees benefits, its very easy to give but very hard to take away.
Its easy with the first ones to give benefits because they will work as hard as you, you tell them that they can take a day of if they want to because you know they work hard.
