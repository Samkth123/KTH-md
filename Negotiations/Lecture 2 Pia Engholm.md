How does a VC work?

Limited partners invest in funds (LPs could be people fmaily offices osv)
You need to pay management fee to fund.
When made money in fund by selling profits and stuff, the profit is split (carry) between LPs and management company
The profit is paid up to the holding company

Difference between angel fund and vc is that angel fund/network are unofficial, they dont have management fee and stuff. They dont invest someone elses money they invest their own money

In DHS 25 angels have invested there. Individuals invest their own money and the part you get from the fund is your own moeny? Usually if my copartners invested i will help them because i have an indirect interest in the company going good. 

If you have an organisation with not very strict rules then it will go away especially since interest will start to fade.


#### An entrepreneurial skillset

Sales, sales, sales
- many people dont like sales
- Every person in founding team must be able to sell
- Not only to customers, but to potential talent and investors

Recruit top talent and build high performing teams
- Will the people pitching be able to build a high performing team?

Read, write and negotiate contracts



### Negotiating with:
- cofounders and investors (termsheet/SHA)
- Employees (employment contracts)
- Customers (customer contract, saas(consiulting(product)))
- distributors
- exit or merger

**Negotiating the SHA with co-founders (share holder agreement)**
- Viktigt, you will always fight
- One person will always not like the decisions taken
- Sign SHA when you are at founding stage
- 2 importnat things
- Vesting: Your shares wont vest until you work for 4 years: so work 1 year u get 25%, 2 year next 25% osv... Normally 3-5 år
	- Nobody wants a broken captable
	- You do not want a former founder with large amount of shares not active in the company
	- Want mechanisms in contract ex bad leaver or good leaver clauses
	- ==startuptools.org for templates==
	- shareholder agreement if very important because investors want it to be good as well

**Negotiating the SHA with angels:**

3 Fs before angel investors: Friends, Family, Fools

Angels dont want special treatment or for anything like minority investor protection

VCs want to find starts and just make them succeed, they dont care about the other companies
- They would rather not spend time on worse companies
Angels will work really hard to make their company succeed, when they are on your side they really are on your side

**Negotiating with VCs**

Not easy
Some VCs are good, some are bad
Their business model is to find the unicorns and really spend their time and money with the unicorns
Some of the VCs are happy with just a 3-4x return
Could be one person in the VC that is really good which you want to work with which will put time for you

Pia:
- Try to create stronger position
- If we cant agree i dont need you
- Make your position stronger than it is even though it might not be
- Think about the details of the contract
- Dont want a owner with too much power or be careful when someone starts acquiring shares

Recognize and be away of and try to avoid dirty terms from VCs:
- VCs often asks for preferential shares (whenever sale of company they get their money first, thye hsould get money before founders)
	- So if you ahve pref shares in A,B and C round it gets really complicated and it will block stuff when things go bad

Dont tell investors different stories they know eachother
Find an ally, if one VC accepts a term the others will accept it as well

Big difference between swedish and anglosaxan VCs - English and US VCs are much meaner and tougher. Swedish VCs are much nicer.

#### Negotiating with employees
Have NDA
Have in contract that anything an employee does belongs to you
First 10 employees are more founders than employees
When first "real" employee comes it is differnet because before everyone is sleeping and living your company, but now someone comes and does not feel like a owner of the company in the same way others do. 
When you give employees benefits, its very easy to give but very hard to take away.
Its easy with the first ones to give benefits because they will work as hard as you, you tell them that they can take a day of if they want to because you know they work hard.

When working with employees its important to keep culture building activites away from whats written in written form.

In the beginning, you should fire the employees that are not working very quickly
- if you dont believe in your vision or part of your culture you will regret not firing them
- you cant afford to have the people on that take your time osv...
- Pia: "tell employee to resign and we dont want you here and you will get benefits for doing so" 
	- If the person does not leave can give them another job but keep them away from other people
	- Men detta är fan sämsta advice ever å de e oschysst, bäst å bara säga att det är inte är bra match och att dom får ganska mycket pengar om dom lämnar

There is gender benefit between how employees negotiate
- Males often try to push
- Females do not as much

But female entrepreneurs are more aggressive usually.


#### Negotiating with large customers
If you do consulting work its important that you have IP rights for what you have produced
You can negotiate how you can protect something for your organisation something you build for them

If done good sales job, they usually want your product

Make yourself sound stronger than you are. 

Dont be afraid to push back

Thank you for your input, i need time to think about this

When negotiating price, using anchoring effect, which is: If i tell you this icecream costs 30krs, this will be reference point of ice cream.

So in the start if i tell you it costs 30kr, you will remember it. When i later tell you i sell ice cream for 20kr, you will think oh this is more cheap.


Sometimes får du brösta, men acceptera inte om du inte måste. Låt inte någon annan sätta priset först.

Dont start by negotiating with yourself - dont sit at home and look at the proposal and pull it down all the time. Always start high on the price.

Think of customer value rather than your own cost when deciding pricing point

#### Negotiating with distributors
If you have someone else doing sales for you or other channels doing it then its distributors

Dont be cheap - both of you need to make money
- They should be profitable and growing
