How does a VC work?

Limited partners invest in funds (LPs could be people fmaily offices osv)
You need to pay management fee to fund.
When made money in fund by selling profits and stuff, the profit is split (carry) between LPs and management company
The profit is paid up to the holding company

Difference between angel fund and vc is that angel fund/network are unofficial, they dont have management fee and stuff. They dont invest someone elses money they invest their own money

In DHS 25 angels have invested there. Individuals invest their own money and the part you get from the fund is your own moeny? Usually if my copartners invested i will help them because i have an indirect interest in the company going good. 

If you have an organisation with not very strict rules then it will go away especially since interest will start to fade.
