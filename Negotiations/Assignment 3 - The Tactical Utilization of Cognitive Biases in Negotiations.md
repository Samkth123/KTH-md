The paper conceptualizes the domain of psychological influence in negotiations and thereby proposes seven negotiations tactics which utilize the findings of cognitive bias research.

The only thing that is being used a lot in negotiations right now is **anchoring**:
Anchoring is a heuristic in behavioral finance that describes the subconscious use of irrelevant information, such as the purchase price of a security, as a fixed reference point (or anchor) for making subsequent decisions about that security.

### Paper starts

**Negotiation** is a synonym for **influence**. **Negotiation** is a **mutual persuasion process**

Negotiators are **vulnerable** to **psychological influence**, as their decision making is affected by **cognitive heuristics**. 

**Two or more parties** with **interdependent and potentially conflicting goals** come together, each with the desire to "**obtain a better set of outcomes** than they could achieve if they simply **accepted what the other side would voluntarily give them"**

**Informational influence** means that the influencer seeks to **change** what the target **believes**.

**Normative influence** means that one seeks to **leverage** the targetâ€™s **desire** for a particular type of **relationship** with him or her

This paper develops tactics of psychological influence which neither alter the other party's incentives nor its information set
- Instead, the **utilization** of **cognitive biases** is a kind of informational influence which entails **leveraging** an understanding of **psychological biases and heuristics** to frame ideas and proposals in such a way that they **increase their appeal** to the target.

The fundamental **argument** of **research** on **cognitive biases** in negotiations is that **bargainers** suffer from fundamental *misperceptions* when judging the **risk**, the value of **gambles**, and other objects
