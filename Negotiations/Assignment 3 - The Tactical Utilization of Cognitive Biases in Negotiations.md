The paper conceptualizes the domain of psychological influence in negotiations and thereby proposes seven negotiations tactics which utilize the findings of cognitive bias research.

The only thing that is being used a lot in negotiations right now is **anchoring**:
Anchoring is a heuristic in behavioral finance that describes the subconscious use of irrelevant information, such as the purchase price of a security, as a fixed reference point (or anchor) for making subsequent decisions about that security.

### Paper starts

**Negotiation** is a synonym for **influence**. **Negotiation** is a **mutual persuasion process**

Negotiators are **vulnerable** to **psychological influence**, as their decision making is affected by **cognitive heuristics**. 

**Two or more parties** with **interdependent and potentially conflicting goals** come together, each with the desire to "**obtain a better set of outcomes** than they could achieve if they simply **accepted what the other side would voluntarily give them"**

**Informational influence** means that the influencer seeks to **change** what the target **believes**.

**Normative influence** means that one seeks to **leverage** the target’s **desire** for a particular type of **relationship** with him or her

This paper develops tactics of psychological influence which neither alter the other party's incentives nor its information set
- Instead, the **utilization** of **cognitive biases** is a kind of informational influence which entails **leveraging** an understanding of **psychological biases and heuristics** to frame ideas and proposals in such a way that they **increase their appeal** to the target.

The fundamental **argument** of **research** on **cognitive biases** in negotiations is that **bargainers** suffer from fundamental *misperceptions* when judging the **risk**, the value of **gambles**, and other objects


### Influence tactics utilizing cognitive biases

##### Loss-framing
The **loss-framing tactic** builds on people's **tendency** to pay particular **attention** to the announcement of **negative news** and their urge **to avoid losses**

If want to build a new factory, in the presentation focus on the negatives if it is not built, instead of the positives of it being built
- By focusing on the **negative effects** for the firms and its owners, you can utilize a main insight of prospect theory, that **losses loom larger than gains**

People rather **strive** for **avoiding losses** than for **accumulating gains**

If someone **frames** the exact **same** set of **information** as a **loss**, it will be **more** **influential** than when it is framed as a **gain**.

The effectiveness of loss frames compared to gain frames has especially been shown in medical environments ex testing for HIV and such.
- ex cardealers putting focus on risks of not having warranties

Example of local power sales companies: The company offering products that help to insulate the home told one part of the homeowners that if they insulated their home, they would save a certain amount of dollar per day. Instead, another group was told the daily money amount they would lose if they failed to insulate their home.

**Loss-framing**: Frame proposals in terms of what the other side will lose if they decline a proposal, instead of stating the proposal in terms of what the other side will gain if they accept it

##### The unsought add-on
The **unsought add-on tactic** draws upon the influence of reference points, loss-aversion, and mental accounting on bargainer's decision making.

This is about having the add-ons at the end of a negotiation. If negotiated about something worth 1 million and done and both are happy, then adding another demand for something worth 1000 is less important at the end of the negotiation.

ex: Car salespeople someone bought car 200k and add stereosystem for 10k extra


**The unsought add-on**: When asking for a concession, frame the concession against the larger magnitude of the whole contract.

##### The cheap concession
The following tactic utilizes the fact that, due to loss aversion, people put a higher value on an object that they own than on an identical one which they do not

The "cheap concession" tactic capitalizes on the psychological principle known as the **endowment effect**. This effect suggests that people tend to **assign more value** to things simply because they **own** them, compared to identical items they **don't own**. Loss aversion, a related concept, means that people prefer avoiding losses more than acquiring equivalent gains.

During a negotiation process, parties constantly gain virtual possession on single attributes and afterwards feel entitled to the specific value on this attribute
- Heyman et al. (2004) called this phenomenon of attachment to a not yet owned item the **quasi-endowment** effect.

Mary uses the impact of the endowment effect by framing her proposal in a way that her concession is seen by her boss as a part of his endowment. Since giving up such a concession would be viewed as a loss, her boss puts a higher value on this item.
- Chefen ser Mary ge upp SIN EGEN bil, vilket ses som mer värt då hon ger bort något som är hennes

This circumstance alone does not foster Mary’s bargaining power. However, once parties start to make concession reciprocally, her boss becomes **attached** to the **earlier proposed concession**. Thus, he agrees upon the final deal which entails the same concession but with a huge improvement for Mary’s position

In general, negotiators should be **careful** to express proposals which promise the counterparty **items** which are **essential** for their own negotiation outcome. Since such a proposal increases the attachment of the counterparty to these items, negotiators will later have to **pay a lot more** in form of other concessions to win these attributes **back**.

The cheap concession: Make early concessions which only include items of low personal value.

Cheap concession tactic använder endowment effect på det sättet att din motpart ser dig ge upp något som är ditt, och därför tror sig att du gör en större uppoffring än du gör, även om det är något som inte betyder något för dig
##### The Janus-faced present

Similar to the cheap concession tactic, the next tactic also obtains its effectiveness because of the endowment effect.

Basically ge proposals i början som motparten inte bett om, ex säljer pizza kedjor så lovar jag att inte gå in i marknaden igen. Dom kommer känna sig entitled till detta och i slutet kan man använda det typ jag kan komma ner till ert pris om vi inte har detta, annars kör vi mitt pris.


**The Janus-faced present**: Make early proposals which include only concessions of low objective value

##### Smart (de)aggregation
The smart bundling tactic uses another insight of prospect theory. Since bargainers make decisions based on the potential value of losses and gains rather than on the ultimate result, their decisions are vulnerable to psychological influence

Ex: Josh sells turbines. Client will need to replace several turbines which is very costly. Instead Josh puts focus on the gain & cost-saving effects of each individual turbine rather than the sum of all turbines cost.

How did Josh get his client to purchase the set of new turbines? Josh acknowledged that **individuals** prefer **receiving money** in **several payments** but **losing money all at one**.

Due to diminishing marginal utility associated with gains and diminishing marginal disutility associated with losses, people view additional gains more pleasurable than the initial gain, and additional losses not as painful as the initial loss

Thus, by focusing on the positive effects of each single turbine, Josh increased the associated value for his client.

One should let out positive information piece by piece whereas bad updates should be bundled and reported all at once in order to (min)maximize the other party’s (dis)comfort.

**Smart bundling**: In a proposal, include two or more small gains instead of one gain of equal magnitude.

##### Stonewalling
The often displayed behavior of delaying and decelerating negotiations cannot only be attributed to a possibly insecure bargaining behavior. Instead, it is often used deliberately as a tactic which can increase the chance of the other party's escalation of commitment.

The behavior of Sophia’s new employer was an example of the many occasions where individuals can become locked into a costly course of action, and even escalate their commitment to it. 

After a negative feedback, individuals stick to their course of action because of the underlying mechanism of self-justification which describes the desire of individuals to justify their past behaviors and the choices to maintain positive, consistent self-perception

Sales professionals often exploit this principle by inducing people to make an initial commitment which is consistent with the later requests they will ask for. A common example is the foot-in-the-door technique.
- After bargainers ask for a small favor that is certainly granted, they continue with a request for a larger favor to which people might agree on in order to stay consistent with their prior course of action.

##### The decoy
The final tactic is based on another irregularity of human decision making. The inclusion of an additional, yet clearly unattractive option can cause a change in the choice behavior of individuals.


It argues that individuals who heuristically examine the dominance relationships between alternatives also take irrelevant information into account when making a choice
- This effect is also called the asymmetric dominance effect and describes the change in choice behavior when individuals are presented two options and another third which is completely dominated by one option and only partially dominated by the other

**Example of the Asymmetric Dominance Effect**:
**Scenario: Subscription Plans**

Imagine a magazine company offers two subscription plans:

- **Online Subscription**: $50/year (access to online content only)
- **Print Subscription**: $100/year (access to print editions only)

Faced with these choices, consumers might be divided, with some preferring the cheaper online subscription and others valuing the print edition enough to pay extra.

**Introduction of a Decoy:**

The company then introduces a third option:

- **Print + Online Subscription**: $100/year (access to both print editions and online content)

**Effect of the Decoy:**

The third option asymmetrically dominates the Print Subscription because it offers everything the Print Subscription does (print edition access) plus additional value (online content access) at the same price. It doesn't dominate the Online Subscription directly because it's more expensive, but it makes the Print + Online Subscription seem like a much better value compared to just the Print Subscription.

**Result:**

Customers who might have been on the fence between online and print could now see the Print + Online Subscription as the best value, leading to an increased preference for it over just the Print Subscription. The presence of the decoy (the Print Subscription at $100) shifts customer preference towards the Print + Online option, despite the Online Subscription being the cheapest.

The decoy also features the principle of loss aversion. Since Peter thought that the dominant options presented a bargain compared to the dominated option, he became afraid of missing out and loosing this seemingly unique opportunity. Thus, Victoria knew that Peter would be more likely to choose the renovated apartment (the dominating option) if she would also present him the not renovated one (the asymmetrically dominated option)

**The decoy**: Include another fake-option (the decoy) when presenting two options to choose from in order to increase the probability that the more profitable one will be chosen.![[Screenshot 2024-04-06 at 15.02.44.png]]

Tactics based on the utilization of cognitive biases distinguish themselves from other aggressive bargaining tactics through their subtleness. Therefore, though they might not be effective against hostile counterparts in purely distributive negotiations, they could be successfully employed in integrative negotiations without impeding the negotiators’ relationship.
