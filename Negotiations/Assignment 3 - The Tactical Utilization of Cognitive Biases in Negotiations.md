The paper conceptualizes the domain of psychological influence in negotiations and thereby proposes seven negotiations tactics which utilize the findings of cognitive bias research.

The only thing that is being used a lot in negotiations right now is **anchoring**:
Anchoring is a heuristic in behavioral finance that describes the subconscious use of irrelevant information, such as the purchase price of a security, as a fixed reference point (or anchor) for making subsequent decisions about that security.

### Paper starts

**Negotiation** is a synonym for **influence**. **Negotiation** is a **mutual persuasion process**

Negotiators are **vulnerable** to **psychological influence**, as their decision making is affected by **cognitive heuristics**. 

**Two or more parties** with **interdependent and potentially conflicting goals** come together, each with the desire to "**obtain a better set of outcomes** than they could achieve if they simply **accepted what the other side would voluntarily give them"**
