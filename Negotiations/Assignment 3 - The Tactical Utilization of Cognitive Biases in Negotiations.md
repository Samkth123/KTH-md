The paper conceptualizes the domain of psychological influence in negotiations and thereby proposes seven negotiations tactics which utilize the findings of cognitive bias research.

The only thing that is being used a lot in negotiations right now is **anchoring**:
Anchoring is a heuristic in behavioral finance that describes the subconscious use of irrelevant information, such as the purchase price of a security, as a fixed reference point (or anchor) for making subsequent decisions about that security.

### Paper starts

**Negotiation** is a synonym for **influence**. **Negotiation** is a **mutual persuasion process**

Negotiators are **vulnerable** to **psychological influence**, as their decision making is affected by **cognitive heuristics**. 

**Two or more parties** with **interdependent and potentially conflicting goals** come together, each with the desire to "**obtain a better set of outcomes** than they could achieve if they simply **accepted what the other side would voluntarily give them"**

**Informational influence** means that the influencer seeks to **change** what the target **believes**.

**Normative influence** means that one seeks to **leverage** the targetâ€™s **desire** for a particular type of **relationship** with him or her

This paper develops tactics of psychological influence which neither alter the other party's incentives nor its information set
- Instead, the **utilization** of **cognitive biases** is a kind of informational influence which entails **leveraging** an understanding of **psychological biases and heuristics** to frame ideas and proposals in such a way that they **increase their appeal** to the target.

The fundamental **argument** of **research** on **cognitive biases** in negotiations is that **bargainers** suffer from fundamental *misperceptions* when judging the **risk**, the value of **gambles**, and other objects


### Influence tactics utilizing cognitive biases

##### Loss-framing
The **loss-framing tactic** builds on people's **tendency** to pay particular **attention** to the announcement of **negative news** and their urge **to avoid losses**

If want to build a new factory, in the presentation focus on the negatives if it is not built, instead of the positives of it being built
- By focusing on the **negative effects** for the firms and its owners, you can utilize a main insight of prospect theory, that **losses loom larger than gains**

People rather **strive** for **avoiding losses** than for **accumulating gains**

If someone **frames** the exact **same** set of **information** as a **loss**, it will be **more** **influential** than when it is framed as a **gain**.

The effectiveness of loss frames compared to gain frames has especially been shown in medical environments ex testing for HIV and such.
- ex cardealers putting focus on risks of not having warranties

Example of local power sales companies: The company offering products that help to insulate the home told one part of the homeowners that if they insulated their home, they would save a certain amount of dollar per day. Instead, another group was told the daily money amount they would lose if they failed to insulate their home.

**Loss-framing**: Frame proposals in terms of what the other side will lose if they decline a proposal, instead of stating the proposal in terms of what the other side will gain if they accept it

##### The unsought add-on
The **unsought add-on tactic** draws upon the influence of reference points, loss-aversion, and mental accounting on bargainer's decision making.

This is about having the add-ons at the end of a negotiation. If negotiated about something worth 1 million and done and both are happy, then adding another demand for something worth 1000 is less important at the end of the negotiation.

ex: Car salespeople someone bought car 200k and add stereosystem for 10k extra


**The unsought add-on**: When asking for a concession, frame the concession against the larger magnitude of the whole contract.
