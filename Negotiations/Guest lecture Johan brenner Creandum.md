low frequency and high conviction so very active in their companies

At inception mostly you get angels, when you are early stage you get venture capital then growth is private equity then last stage is ip or m&a

questions to ask for hoimerun potential: is business model good enough and is market big enough?

The power law: The more failed companies you have the more return on the fund because you take more risk i guess?

The better the entrepreneur the better because they can source money from many more people as well as they are good at hiring right people osv...

Reputation marketing is very important

**Limited partners** (“LPs”) commit capital to a venture fund

MoIC = Multiple on invested capital

More competition between VCs in early stage as later stage investors are starting to come to early stage as well


What is right thing to showcase as a founder in pitchdeck
- most important to describe problem you are trying to solve clearly
- describe solution clearly
- why its a big opportunity
- why we are right founder team to execute it

What qualities of founder?
- usually want 2 entrepreneurs in founding team than one solo
- usually look at how someone pitchs - can you explain stuff in a concise and clear way? are you a salesperson? What people do you sorround yourself with and have you hired somebody yet? Do you show passion, perserverance, stamina, never give up and something that drives you?
