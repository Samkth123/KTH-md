low frequency and high conviction so very active in their companies

At inception mostly you get angels, when you are early stage you get venture capital then growth is private equity then last stage is ip or m&a

questions to ask for hoimerun potential: is business model good enough and is market big enough?

The power law: The more failed companies you have the more return on the fund because you take more risk i guess?

The better the entrepreneur the better because they can source money from many more people as well as they are good at hiring right people osv...

Reputation marketing is very important

**Limited partners** (“LPs”) commit capital to a venture fund

MoIC = Multiple on invested capital

More competition between VCs in early stage as later stage investors are starting to come to early stage as well


What is right thing to showcase as a founder in pitchdeck
- most important to describe problem you are trying to solve clearly
- describe solution clearly
- why its a big opportunity
- why we are right founder team to execute it

What qualities of founder?
- usually want 2 entrepreneurs in founding team than one solo
- usually look at how someone pitchs - can you explain stuff in a concise and clear way? are you a salesperson? What people do you sorround yourself with and have you hired somebody yet? Do you show passion, perserverance, stamina, never give up and something that drives you?

Always better to invest in a great founder and bad idea than a bad founder and great idea


What creandum is looking for:
- Amazing team
- Great product
- Huge market

tranche means invest in turns

Hot list is good way of seeing if a company or not

Early stage valuation is a mix of:
- funds needed to aheive a milestone for next funding round - typically 12 to 18 months
- 20% ownership target by VC
- Enough ownership for founders/management
- Likely next round valuation

^^Here:
- the team is the company
- process and structures of the company loosely defined
- none or limited historical data on performance
- underlying market might not exist yet
- main goald to find PMF and get traction going

Need to have a good valuation that after seed you dont go down when doing A-series



Typical terms:
- money: invested amount and pre money valuation
- preference shares: participating and non participating
- safe notes: cap, discount 
- option pool for management
- reverse vesting of founder shares
- drag and tag along
- board representation
- veto vatalogue
- exclusivity
- lock up (ex dont let entrepreneurs sell any shares until 3-4 years)

Founder dos and donts

Dos
- try to get a warm intro which means try to see people around you and see who you know and stuff and get into through eferences
- have a flawless product demo and not too long
- know your numbers, industry and market
- know what you dont know (admit if you dont know)
- show your passion (why are you passionate, achievements in the past)
- be prepared for a 15 min meeting (say in first 5 min what you want to get across)

Donts:
- Send generic intro emails to investors (try to contact investors in other way)
- Undersestimeate the soft values and personal connection with investor
- give out too much ownership early (but remember its better to own 1% of shell than 100% of a gas station) make sure you have not given away too much ownership if you can
- exxagerate or makethings up
- hide deal breakers before financ
