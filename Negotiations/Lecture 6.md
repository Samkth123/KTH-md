BATNA
- **best alternative to negotiated agreement** - what you will get if there is no deal/agreement
- basically what is your second best option 
- typically if you walk away from this negotiation or deal what is your second best option?
- ex apartment if negioate with someone on apartment then the other offer is your BATNA
- could be more tricky if consulting because if get deal here what is the worth of deal somewhere else?
- important to figure out and put number on a number on the BATNA because it gives you a reservation price for this negotiatiotion.
Reservation price
- basically if you have another offer for 300k then your reservation price in this negotiation is atleast 300k
- the value (maximumu or minimum) at which you would be indifferent between entering or not entering into and agreement aka your bottom line
- your BATNA determines your reservation price
ZOPA: Zone Of Possible Agreement
- lets say seller has reservation price of 50 but want as much as possible. Buyer has reservation price of 100 but would like less
- The ZOPA is between 50 and 100 and when you go into a negotioatin you do not know the other persons reservation price.
- could be straightforward tex sälja headphones
- but could be more complex tex you graduate and have two different job offers where one looks better on salary but the higher paying job could be much further away. Need to put financial value on all components that go into the deal
- The broader the ZOPA is the easier it is to get a deal and the more narrow the easier it is to get a deal

Positions and interests
- positions are typically what is being discussed and quantitated ex price, number of people, delivery times, number of days, percentages basically contract terms and numbers
- often positions are too far apart when negotiations get stuck
- interests are a bit trickier, they are not whats in the contract and not being discussed but they are importnat to different parties pga different reasons.
- Lets say we give two factors/positions: price and number of thigns, but say i have interest of closing fast becuase i want my bonus so my interest is to do this fast
- or if im a startup owner i want money form VC but my interest is to get you as a pro VC to show off to others
- Typically when there is a win-win deal the parties get their interests given
- the tricky thing is in order to get a deal you should bring up what you want ex if i want a quick deal i can say it so that "yea we can discuss price buy i want a quick deal before midsummer"
	- but careful when say this

BATNA checklist
- what are the real consequences if this deal falls through?
- How should we value that (considering all costs & benefits, short- and long-term?)
- How should our BATNA affect our strategy?

Tex google want to hire good engineer but the engineer has lots of offers from other places so he has high BATNA


One other way to visualize position and interests 
-->
triangle med 
price 
time 
quiality

you can prioritize 2 of these but miss out on one in the triangle.
You have different positions but interest says which one is most important


Deals are only relevant if they are in oine with your interests

parties might have an incentive to misdirect/misrepresent the truth (=lie) in order to close the deal - but remember that you are then stuck with it

In this case of bollard houses the buyers wanted to lie and misdirect so they can just buy it because it doesnt matter later as they will not be working together

People tend to want to close as they have been in negotiations a long time, but if you have other deals, you should find better deals
