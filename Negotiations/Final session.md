Final negotiation exercise:

Open negotiation

Moms.com

Two aprty negotiation

Seller- Hollyville
Buyer - WCHI

Non negotiable
- 100 episodes
- 5 year lease

To be negotiated:
- price
- Financing
- Runs
- Other?


Grupp 6:
7 runs
60k price
juniors 20k
50 25 25 financing


This was negotiating your first term sheet
60000 25000 are ZOPA

Challenge on termsheet is you intuitievelly try to focus on big thing like the price, but might have noticed how the other terms have big impact on total value
- so more important to go down?

positions and interest here:
- The runs are worth more to the buyer than financing cost but to seller the financing cost is more important
- Usually want to negotiate to the max each step

Win-Win hack is to identify the priorities of the other party and then trade

issue between ratings that each side have calculated.
- Challenge to negotiate this because it is based on assumptions
- If someone can övertala någon då är de winlose här
- Way to do is is to bett of different expectations if then
- so if ratings are <4 then WCHI recceives 1 MM rebate from Hollyville
- If ratings are 5< then WCHI pays 1MM surcharge to Hollyville

^^DETTA VAR VÄLDIGT BRA
- ifall du inte når upp till dina expectations so kommer vi betala samma men ta ifrån er
- classic entrepreneur earnout
	- founders need to earnout buyouts over a few years instead of just suddenly getting the money


Use of time: avoid (too) fast agreements
- the goal of a negotiation is not a fast agreement the goal is the best possible agreement
- if you have reached an agreement in priniple see if yoiu can find an. even better (win win) aggreement
- image of negotiation: in the start its fist against fist but then towards the end its more as if we are partners, then it would be good to see if there are anything that is more importnat to the other group that is less important to us (interests)
	- basically add cherry on top to get a good agreement for both parts

If someone just agrees directly then heads out then that might be lite oroväckande för er


Course objective of this course is active and experiential learning to learn negotiations
