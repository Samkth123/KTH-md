**VAD VI VILL HA**
Vi vill ha 8 modeller, worst case 6 ( want 10 )

150 each model, total of 1200 each year (säg att vi vill ha mellan 800)

Beta vill ha artificial vision research, vi vill bara ge om vi får allt annat. (vi vill få assembly tech)
- Alpha already agreed on helping us, only right if we help them but we want more

We pay 3%, only 7% if allt ovanför är bra (säg 0,5% royalty)
- you have supply chain and infrastructure, we have the distribution channels and sales engine.
- 0,5% feels like reasonable rate

dom vill expand

**Resten**:
How big marketshare does Beta inc have? Large market but you are R&D focused
- we are more sales and can help you sell

They will give up the concesion of not entering alpha market
- Beta want to come to our market

Vi kan gå till 150 andra robotics companies if this is not good enough for us

We will be able to produce robots in 2-3 years


**In the last hypothethical meeting:**

Agreed relationship will be for 5 years
We will recieve fully manufactured robots
Later on Alpha will be able to use robots using beta technology
