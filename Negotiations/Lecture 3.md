Notes:

What **inferences** did you draw from the behavior?

Where can we find culture(s)?
- nations, industries t.ex. phd physics vs investment bankers differ, usually people who go into a new culture adjusts to that culture. Different big companies have different types of cultures. Boeing and mcdonald douglas had different cultures, and mcdonald douglas culture took over and therefore quality went down. Some VCs are nice to work with and some are less nice to work with, people who join those firms get different negotiation styles. Even in same company cultures differ ex sales vs engineers. 
	- Important to anticipate differences in negotiation style/sources of misunderstandings 
	- analyze intercultural differences and try to identify win-win opportunities (men måste också tänka på att en fransk å engelsk lawyer är mer lika än olika de oklart oftast)
	- if get annoyed with other part maybe they want the deal but they are different culture and different way of negotiating
	- could lead to no deal subconsiously if other party sees the other party as rude or

**VAD VI VILL HA**
Vi vill ha 8 modeller, worst case 6 ( want 10 ) Dyrt för dom att ge 10 modeller

150 each model, total of 1200 each year (säg att vi vill ha mellan 800)

Beta vill ha artificial vision research, vi vill bara ge om vi får allt annat. (vi vill få assembly tech)
- Alpha already agreed on helping us, only right if we help them but we want more

We pay 3%, only 7% if allt ovanför är bra (säg 0,5% royalty)
- you have supply chain and infrastructure, we have the distribution channels and sales engine.
- 0,5% feels like reasonable rate

dom vill expand
you do not have a lot of exports

**Resten**:
How big marketshare does Beta inc have? Large market but you are R&D focused
- we are more sales and can help you sell

They will give up the concesion of not entering alpha market
- Beta want to come to our market

Vi kan gå till 150 andra robotics companies if this is not good enough for us

We will be able to produce robots in 2-3 years


**In the last hypothethical meeting:**

Agreed relationship will be for 5 years
We will recieve fully manufactured robots
Later on Alpha will be able to use robots using beta technology
non exclusive
