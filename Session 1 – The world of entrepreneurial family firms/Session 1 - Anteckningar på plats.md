## Introduction

##### Why a course on family firms
- Most common type of business organization
- Family firms are key for GDP, employment and economic development. Family firms are a huge part of the economy in many countries, some more some less
- Family firms drive innovation and entrepreneurship
	- Families are the most entrepreneurial teams, ex. siblings or couple, or 2 generations osv...
- Family office - entrepreneurs that have been successful form a **family office**
	- Very important in supporting startups as well.
	- A lot of money flowing into entrepreneurial ecosystems are from family firms
- Lead sustainability and social engagement
	- Strong agenda in family firms on this, including philanthropy
	- You care about your reputation. Ex in Sweden, everyone knows eachother because its a smaller country, so if you do something bad everyone will know
	- Direct correlation to the family (family firms maybe have their face on the varumärke)
- Based on people, relationships and emotions
- Are different - unique strengths and weaknesses

#### The worlds oldest and most common form of business organization
In Sweden - 50% of all employment is family firms
Family firms keep employees longer than non-family firms in recessions
- As there are both financial goals, but also other goals

#### What is a family firm?

**Ownerships of shares** --> concentrated 50% + --> majority by people of family, but this is different for public companies
**Management/governance** --> Does the family need to be represented by a governance? --> Depends on if you want to ahve a stronger or weaker definition of family business. Normally a family member does not have to be CEO member, but usually should have family in part of board of leadership.
- Passive governance/ownership is that family has effective and majority control, but they are passive in the way that they do not even have representation in the board, but rather appoint people to represent them. They are more in for the financial performance rather than legacy. Still make sure that the company works in some sort of frame that the owners have set.
- Active governance/ownership är vad det låter som. Make sure direction company develops in is in line with family by being active member
**Identity/perception** --> Owners should see themselves as a family business
**Family dynamics**
