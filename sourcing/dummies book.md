Supply chains are the complex systems made up of people, processes, and technologies that we engineer and manage to deliver the goods and services customers value. Supply chain management is the planning and coordination of the relationships between all the people, processes, and technology involved in creating that value

Supply chain är inte bara inköp, utan hjälper även andra delar av bolaget tex sälj å manufacturing. Alla dessa måste va aligned för att göra profit. 

ex: "A sales rep might hit their quota by landing a huge deal with a customer, for example, but the deal might be unprofitable for the company because of the costs it will drive to the logistics and manufacturing functions”

or

“A buyer might negotiate a volume discount from a supplier without considering how much more it will cost to store and protect all of that extra inventory.”

Lean manufacturing can reduce inventories, same as being responsive to customer needs.
