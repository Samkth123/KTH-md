Supply chains are the complex systems made up of people, processes, and technologies that we engineer and manage to deliver the goods and services customers value. **Supply chain management is the planning and coordination of the relationships between all the people, processes, and technology involved in creating that value**

Supply chain är inte bara inköp, utan hjälper även andra delar av bolaget tex sälj å manufacturing. Alla dessa måste va aligned för att göra profit. 

ex: "A sales rep might hit their quota by landing a huge deal with a customer, for example, but the deal might be unprofitable for the company because of the costs it will drive to the logistics and manufacturing functions”

or

“A buyer might negotiate a volume discount from a supplier without considering how much more it will cost to store and protect all of that extra inventory.”

Lean manufacturing can reduce inventories, same as being responsive to customer needs.

A resilient supply chain requires **scenario planning**. What scenarios are most important to you, what you will do in each scenario and how you can tell when a scenario is becoming reality. Should have sensors that tell you what happens to your cargo if at sea ex pirates, storm, osv...

“You can find more information about supply chain scenario planning, as well as a link to the MIT Scenario Planning Toolkit, in Chapter 15.”

#### Principles of supply chain…
1. Customer focus
	1. **supply chain starts with understanding who your customers are and why they are buying**, as if you understand their problems you can help solve it better faster y cheaper than the competition
2. Systems thinking
	1. **s-chains are combo of people procceses y technologies** that work together and you need to understand the end to end process. Appreciate the **series of cause and effect relationships** within the supply chain
3. Bimodal innovation
	1. need to keep innovation in supply chains 2 types. Must do stuff better faster and cheaper than competitors
		1. Sustaining innovation - continous improvements in process such as lean, six sigma and theory of constraints
		2. disruptive innovation - 
4. Collaboration
	1. work across departments in org & work with suppliers and. ustomers outside org
5. **Flexibility**
	1. How quick supply chain can respond to changes ex increase or decrease in sales. Flexbility comes in forms of buffers such as extra capacity, miultuple sources of supply and alt forms of transport. Flex costs money, but has value.
		1. Think of the extra cost you pay to second supplier as insurance policy
6. Technology
7. Global perspective
8. Risk management
	1. be aware of risks and implement processes to detect and mitigate threats
9. **Visibility**
	1. you cant. manage what you cant see. Knowing what is happening in real time lets you make deciosins fast. You have to build your supplychain in a way that lets you capture data about key steps in the process
10. Value creation
	1. meet customer needs in right place right time right quality and lowest cost

#### Introducing 5 supply chain tasks

- Design supply chain for strategic advantage 
	- how s-chain can create value by operating better, faster and cheaper and comp. Think beyond lowering costs and see how s-chain can help grow revenue, innovate and create new markets
- Implement collaborative relationships
	- if sales wants to improve customer service by making sure lots of inventory exists, a
