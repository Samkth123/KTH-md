Supply chains are the complex systems made up of people, processes, and technologies that we engineer and manage to deliver the goods and services customers value. **Supply chain management is the planning and coordination of the relationships between all the people, processes, and technology involved in creating that value**

Supply chain är inte bara inköp, utan hjälper även andra delar av bolaget tex sälj å manufacturing. Alla dessa måste va aligned för att göra profit. 

ex: "A sales rep might hit their quota by landing a huge deal with a customer, for example, but the deal might be unprofitable for the company because of the costs it will drive to the logistics and manufacturing functions”

or

“A buyer might negotiate a volume discount from a supplier without considering how much more it will cost to store and protect all of that extra inventory.”

Lean manufacturing can reduce inventories, same as being responsive to customer needs.

A resilient supply chain requires **scenario planning**. What scenarios are most important to you, what you will do in each scenario and how you can tell when a scenario is becoming reality. Should have sensors that tell you what happens to your cargo if at sea ex pirates, storm, osv...

“You can find more information about supply chain scenario planning, as well as a link to the MIT Scenario Planning Toolkit, in Chapter 15.”

#### Principles of supply chain…
1. Customer focus
	1. **supply chain starts with understanding who your customers are and why they are buying**, as if you understand their problems you can help solve it better faster y cheaper than the competition
2. Systems thinking
	1. **s-chains are combo of people procceses y technologies** that work together and you need to understand the end to end process. Appreciate the **series of cause and effect relationships** within the supply chain
3. Bimodal innovation
	1. need to keep innovation in supply chains 2 types. Must do stuff better faster and cheaper than competitors
		1. Sustaining innovation - continous improvements in process such as lean, six sigma and theory of constraints
		2. disruptive innovation - 
4. Collaboration
	1. work across departments in org & work with suppliers and. ustomers outside org
5. **Flexibility**
	1. How quick supply chain can respond to changes ex increase or decrease in sales. Flexbility comes in forms of buffers such as extra capacity, miultuple sources of supply and alt forms of transport. Flex costs money, but has value.
		1. Think of the extra cost you pay to second supplier as insurance policy
6. Technology
7. Global perspective
8. Risk management
	1. be aware of risks and implement processes to detect and mitigate threats
9. **Visibility**
	1. you cant. manage what you cant see. Knowing what is happening in real time lets you make deciosins fast. You have to build your supplychain in a way that lets you capture data about key steps in the process
10. Value creation
	1. meet customer needs in right place right time right quality and lowest cost

#### Introducing 5 supply chain tasks

- Design supply chain for strategic advantage 
	- how s-chain can create value by operating better, faster and cheaper and comp. Think beyond lowering costs and see how s-chain can help grow revenue, innovate and create new markets
- Implement collaborative relationships
	- if sales wants to improve customer service by making sure lots of inventory exists, and logistics tries to reduce inventory to reduce costs, we will waste energy
- Forging supply chain partnerships
	- Consider how to forge strong relationshops with customers and suppliers. When understand that depend on eachother for survival, working together becomes prio
- Managing supply chain information
	- If retailer share data upstream the manufacturer and production can do better job of scheduling production and managing inventory. Same as if manufacturer share data of commodity prices and capacity constraints, then retailers can better manage pricing

### “Chapter 2 Seeing Supply Chains from Different Perspectives”

![[Screenshot 2025-07-30 at 23.49.20.png]]
**The purchasing, logistics, and operations teams have conflicting goals — often without realizing it**

- logistics kanske vill ha inventory down, medan purchasing kanske vill köpa stora mängder för att priset ska vara billigare och operations vill ha mycket redo för ifall sälja mycket

”Managing these functions independently can lead to poor overall performance for your company. To meet top-level goals, supply chain managers need to make sure that the objectives of these groups are aligned.”

“The simplest top-level goal for many supply chain decisions is return on investment. Focusing on this one objective can often help everyone see the big picture and look beyond functional supply chain metrics such as capacity utilization or transportation cost.”


#### Purchasing
Purchasing (or procurement) is the function that buys the materials and services that a company uses to produce its own products and services. The basic goal of the purchasing function is to get the stuff that the company needs at the lowest cost possible; the purchasing department is always looking for ways to get a better deal from suppliers. Some of the most common cost-reduction strategies for a purchasing manager are 

Negotiating with a supplier to reduce the supplier’s profit margin
Buying in larger quantities to get a volume discount
Switching to a supplier that charges less for the same product
Switching to a lower-quality product that’s less expensive

“On the surface, any of these four options looks like a simple, effective way to reduce costs and therefore increase profitability, but each can have negative long-term effects”

“Many purchasing decisions can also have direct effects on the costs of other functions within your company. **Sourcing lower-quality raw materials might lead to higher inspection and testing expenses**, for example”

#### Logistics
Logistics covers everything related to moving and storing products. This function involves physical distribution, warehousing, and transportation. Inbound logistics refers to the products that are being shipped to your company by your suppliers. Outbound logistics refers to the products that you ship to your customers. Intralogistics refers to moving and storing products within your own facilities.

**Transporting goods costs money, but that is the same as a product sitting in the distirbution center as then its an asset that ties up working capital.**

“The goals of the logistics function are to move things faster, reduce transportation costs, ensure reliability, and decrease inventory. Following are some ways that a logistics department might try to achieve these goals: 

Consolidating many small shipments into one large shipment to lower shipping costs
Breaking large shipments into smaller ones to increase velocity
Switching from one mode of transportation to another, either to lower costs or increase velocity
Increasing or decreasing the number of distribution centers to increase velocity or lower costs
Outsourcing logistics services to a third-party logistics (3PL) company”

“ Logistics wants to decrease inventory, which may mean ordering in smaller quantities, but purchasing wants to lower the price of the purchased materials, which may mean buying in larger quantities. **Unless purchasing and logistics coordinate their decision-making and align their goals these two functions can end up working against each other and against the best interests of your company, your customers, and your suppliers**.”


#### Operations
Operations is the third key function in supply chain management, involving the processes that your company focuses on to create value



#### Bullwhip effect

A pattern called the Bullwhip Effect, in which inventory peaks and valleys are amplified as they move upstream from one step to the next in a supply chain. The Bullwhip Effect, which occurs often in supply chain systems, is a normal, predictable phenomenon that occurs even when everyone in the supply chain makes decisions that seem to be logical from their point of view. To fix the problem, you need to change the system, which means understanding what is really happening.”

- **Betyder basically at ett litet köp här kan leda till stort upstream**

“Here are three ways that you could change this system to reduce the Bullwhip Effect: 

Make batches smaller. The fewer widgets that the store and the wholesaler need to buy, the less amplification occurs when orders move up the supply chain.
Improve forecasting. If all the partners in the supply chain have a better forecast, there’s less chance of ordering widgets that no one will buy.
Improve communications. If the store, the wholesaler, and the manufacturer know exactly how many widgets are being sold, they can do a better job of planning ahead and managing their inventories.”

“**An important point to notice is that some of the things you could do to reduce the Bullwhip Effect might seem odd to a functional manager. In fact, they might even interfere with some of the objectives of your team members. Smaller batches, for example, are likely to increase costs for both purchasing and logistics**.
”


==**TODO**==!!!! - “(For more information about supply chain modeling and simulation, see Chapter 15.)”


“**A good way to look for improvement opportunities in any process is to compare your own performance with that of someone else. If you use the same KPIs in every facility, then you can compare one facility to another, or ==one company to another==**.”


### Chapter 3 Evaluating Your Supply Chain Strategy”

“Before you can manage something, you have to understand how it works and what you want it to do. A supply chain is no exception.”

#### Step 1: Understand what customers value

“ The purpose of a supply chain is to deliver value to a customer, so your first step in engineering and managing a supply chain should be to understand exactly what your customers value. They may value having a wide assortment of products to choose among, or they might prefer to have a smaller number of options at a lower price. Your customers may value having products available immediately for pickup or having them delivered at a time they choose”

ab testing to see what they value the most


#### Step 2: Recognize your competitors

“The next step in prioritizing your supply chain goals is recognizing your competitors. Because of the Internet, your competitors may not be who you think they are. Traditional retail stores need to compete with websites like Amazon.com”

**“To understand who your real competitors are, you need to stop thinking about the product or service that you sell and start thinking about the problem that it solves**. Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School called this approach the ==Jobs to Be Done Theory==. Think about what “job” your product or service does for your customers and what other products or services might be able to do that same job better, faster, cheaper, or more reliably. These alternative products (or services) are your product’s real competitors.”

#### Step 3: Understand your products or services
“The next step in prioritizing your supply chain goals is understanding the characteristics of your products or services. The easiest way to illustrate this step is to show how different kinds of products need to achieve different goals to deliver the greatest value to their customers.”

#### “Building the Right Supply Chain”

“Capacity:Capacity refers to how much product or service your supply chain can produce in a given period. One of the main goals of supply chain management is to provide your customers with as much of your products or services as they’re willing to buy. If you don’t have enough capacity, your customers will have to go without the products they want, or they’ll buy from your competitor. But if you have too much capacity, you’re tying up capital without generating a return.”

“Responsiveness:Responsiveness is the measure of how quickly your supply chain can provide a product or service to a customer”

“Flexibility:Flexibility is the measurement of how well your supply chain scales up or ramps down in response to change. If customers always wanted the same stuff in the same quantities and at regular intervals, supply chain management would be a whole lot simpler. But that’s not the way things work in the real world. One week, everyone is buying doughnuts, and no one is buying ice cream. The next week, everyone is buying ice cream, and no one is buying doughnuts. Supply chains must have the flexibility to respond to those changes in demand.”

“Cost:Cost, of course, is the amount of money it takes to operate your supply chain. Supply chain management needs to provide the capacity, responsiveness, and flexibility that your customers need at the lowest possible cost”

#### “Looking at Cost Drivers”

Procurement costs
- “Some common ways to reduce procurement costs are to negotiate **better prices from your suppliers, agree to buy larger quantities over a longer period, or switch to a supplier that agrees to accept lower prices**. Also, **each supplier that you work with costs you money**, because someone has to find the supplier, sign all the contracts, keep track of the supplier’s performance, and make sure the supplier gets paid. So the cost for procurement also includes the salaries and overhead for your procurement team. **Reducing the number of suppliers you work with and streamlining your procurement processes can often reduce procurement overhead costs**.”

Transportation
- “Moving a product from one place to another costs money, and different modes of transportation have different costs. These modes have different speeds, which can be just as important as transportation cost. **A faster and more expensive transportation mode might actually save you money by decreasing the amount of inventory that you have in transit**, for example. It’s also common to use more than one mode of transportation to move a single product through a supply chain. Changing from one mode to another by using multimodal transportation can optimize transportation costs. Another common way to reduce transportation costs is to pack more products into each load, thereby improving capacity utilization. **The important thing to remember is that choosing a transportation mode that is slower and less reliable may reduce transportation costs, but it will increase your inventory and consume more working capital**. ”

Inventory costs
- “Keeping products in inventory costs money. If you’re borrowing money from the bank to pay for that inventory (which is often the case), your inventory costs you whatever interest rate you’re paying to the bank. Other costs include paying for a building to keep the inventory safe and paying people to move the inventory around inside the building. You also run the risk that products could be lost, damaged, or stolen. This problem, often called shrinkage, also creates a cost to your company. Finally, products can expire, deteriorate, evaporate, or become obsolete if they sit in a warehouse or a retail store for too long. These all contribute to your inventory holding cost.”

Quality costs
- “When you buy a product, you expect it to meet a certain level of quality. In some cases, you may need to have formal inspection and quality assurance processes in place to make sure that the products you receive from suppliers and the products you send to your customers meet these requirements. Any product that doesn’t meet these standards costs you money, and the more closely you have to look for quality problems, the more money you spend. Reducing the variation in manufacturing and distribution processes through techniques such as Lean and Six Sigma, ==which are discussed in Chapter 16==, can reduce the quality costs in a supply chain.”


#### “Dealing with Trade-Offs”

Conflicts occur between two functions in the business and you need to make trade offs to maximize the overall profit of the business

Sales vs Operations
- Sales säger kan inte sälja de du inte har, medan operations handlar om att ha bara store så många produkter du faktiskt behöver
- **Basically have a meeting with them and do S&OPP**
