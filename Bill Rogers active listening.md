Tools:

- Actually be very active and present in the listening
- Repeat things someone says in the way the responwe becomes a summary of what they said, so you know that you understood them (in turn this makes them feel heard also)
- Minimal encouragers:
	- Non verbal communication - showing empathy when listening
	- emotional labelling
		- After talking to someone for a little bit, you practice labelling their emotions in a empathetic manner
		- ex: I guess that must be nice to be done with, or i guess your happy, osv...
		- akward at first but if you do it naturally and casually its normal
- Understand value of actually trying to understand people. If you actually try to understand people, you realize how interesting people actually can be.

#### Never running out of things to say:

People say things but dont say the entire thing. They might not even know what they want to say.

- **Best to do is active listening with presence. Your brain automatically starts asking questions.** 
	- If you genuinly try to be interested in people, your brain will come up with so many questions. For example
	- "I cut my hand on Sunday while working on a car"
	- Questions then pop up:
		- What kind of car?
		- How did you cut your hand
		- Do you usually work on cars?
		- Is it a normal sunday thing or only now
		- Why did you need to do work on it at all?
		- What cars do you like? 
- Develop personality using interests of stuff people speak about (ahh inte min grej detta)
	- Mer att man kan istället vara humble och fråga om dessa sakerna istället
- Curious questions when have nothing to say
	- how tall are you, do you mow the lawn, osv...
	- Ask stuff that lets you get a better picture of that person, and the converstaion will start going in another direction which indirectly becomes fun
