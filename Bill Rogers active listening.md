Tools:

- Actually be very active and present in the listening
- Repeat things someone says in the way the responwe becomes a summary of what they said, so you know that you understood them (in turn this makes them feel heard also)
- Minimal encouragers:
	- Non verbal communication - showing empathy when listening
	- emotional labelling
		- After talking to someone for a little bit, you practice labelling their emotions in a empathetic manner
		- ex: I guess that must be nice to be done with, or i guess your happy, osv...
		- akward at first but if you do it naturally and casually its normal
