The pyramid of CST_
- foundation is profitable - can have lots of discussions if this should be the foundation or not - maybe for NGOs, but view professor has then being profitable means you are using resources in right way and can show that you can use them correctly.
	- so if you really want to contribute to society in a way is to generate profit in your company then give away the money
- Legal is next to most important thing
	- play by the rules of the game
- ethical
	- do what is right and fair
	- ex child labour bad but maybe in vietnam its ok?
	- for example people who move companies to other countries to not have taxes?
		- it is legal and follow laws, but is it ethical that we use public funded stuff in sweden but dont want to pay taxes
- Philantropic is the top, so you contribute resources to improve life of others

Porter 5 forces exercise
==- electric bike market we know has many players, because if there only was lik 2 big players we would most likely know their names
	- ex not everyone has a car but know about ex Volvo and such==

- carve out uniqueness - do something unique
- building barriers - make it difficult for other people to move in

Volvo buys inbound logistics, then puts together in operations then in outbound logistics they give it to retailers and sales, then they do marketing and sales then service the cars
Then you have things you do for all these things, you do procurement (buying the things), tech development you do in all, you then have human resource management where you recruit people and managethem, and lastly you have firm infrastructure like phones computer offices etc...

inbound logistics är inte svårt - basically ask someone who works with it and they fix it
operations is having everything going, so making the product, if you are getting the product then you dont do this
==outbound logistics== - can also outsource it, basically tell someone with warehouse to take it in then deliver it somewhere 


New Markets - New industry entries - Entry strategies (well documented in a book he will post in the modules)
Called the ==Radio Model== WBMH (why? bring? meet? how?)
Summary

	- and does it fit with overall strategy?

BRING checklist
- products and concepts
	- compare to locally offered
	- improved
	- unique new offer

- patented techs and firm specific capabilities
- Manufacturing capacity
- capital

MEET

- host demand characteristics and segments

- host indsutry and reactions
	- host entry barriers
	- ==history of retaliation of entry== (has anyone else entered this market and what happened to them? For example what do existing companies do to new entrants? ex swedish banks did not retaliate against klarna now they are so big)
	- host vertical structure
- Host cluster environemnt
	- network and relationships?
		- ex certain religion, or some specific family? do suppliers want to work with you or will give you unfair conditions because of their rleationships to existing people

==Gate openers== (to get into host industry)
- vantage point
	- you are skilled at what you do ex IKEA knows well to set up new store and have supply chains, so they can enter any market without bigger issue.
- De novo entrant
	- Means that you are completely new but you are doing it anyway.
	- Basically a company with a lot of money that know nothing about telekom (3 sverige) and decides to buy all services and competence and start such a company
- ==Gate opener==
	- Volvo decided to team up with renault because saw that there was product fit and they agreed to be gate opener on swedish market for renault and in return renault opened up french market for volvo
