The pyramid of CST_
- foundation is profitable - can have lots of discussions if this should be the foundation or not - maybe for NGOs, but view professor has then being profitable means you are using resources in right way and can show that you can use them correctly.
	- so if you really want to contribute to society in a way is to generate profit in your company then give away the money
- Legal is next to most important thing
	- play by the rules of the game
- ethical
	- do what is right and fair
	- ex child labour bad but maybe in vietnam its ok?
	- for example people who move companies to other countries to not have taxes?
		- it is legal and follow laws, but is it ethical that we use public funded stuff in sweden but dont want to pay taxes
- Philantropic is the top, so you contribute resources to improve life of others
