Läraren tycker att basically det som behövs i en business plan är:
What you sell, to whom, why, what price, and 1 more thing

#### Prototyping today

- A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a  product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.  
- Prototyping is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users  
- Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working system rather than a theoretical one

##### Use prototypes as/instead of market research:
- In the early days of an organization, there is high uncertainty about exactly what you should create and exactly what customers want. In these times, traditional market research is useless—there is no survey or focus group that can predict customer acceptance for a product or service that you may barely be able to describe. 
- Would you buy a new computer with no software, no hard disk, and no color that simulates the real world— including a trash can?
