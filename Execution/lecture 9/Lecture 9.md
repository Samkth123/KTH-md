### Funding for Startups

3 things that need to be balanced in triangle:
- resources
- time (deadline)
- quality 


When started business you have cash situation

- Need to have a cash flow forecast (both for your control and funding)
	- This is a key to funding, given that you have a good business

Erik Skoglund när köpte företag hade rolling schedule av cash flow varje vecka för att se hur saker går.

Can do lots of things with bookkeping and profits and such, but cash is cash, and if cash is increasing you are alright but if decreasing not good.

##### Reason for funding
Cash flow challenges
- organization (if recruit sales person costs money before is productive)
- inventory
- marketing

Capital investments
- buying real estate 
- building facilities
- purchasing equpoment

Product development
- lif science
- high test

Three types of financing sources

- bootstrapping
	- owner
	- family,friends
	- customers, suppliers (can ask custaomers to pay early, ==JAG GÖR + tar inte ut salary==)
	- subsidies
- Equity financing
	- private equity (business angels, ventuer capital, buy out capital)
	- Public equity (IPO)
- Debt financing
	- commercial loans and credits
	- governmental debt
- Other
	- crowdfunding
	- incubators


Shares vs own work (your time is worth something, ==berötta om delningen med krille==)
- concept is worth 600 k sek
- i work iwthout salry could earn 35k per month which is 20k per month after tax. 18 months 20 k = 360k
- offer: familt/Friends 20% of compant for 240 k sek
- shares
	- entreprenur 960k (80%)
	- familyfienrsd 240k 20%
	- 1200k total


Ibbe Gnem method
- work for salary
- save 50% of disposable income
- After 6 months you can work on startup for 6 months without salary
- After 12 months you ahve 12 months to go



Catch 22 
- impossible situation basically
- banks will lend you umbrella when its sunny outside, but want it back when its rainy

Five C's when borrowing money
- Capacity (company, personla, ability to pay back loan)
- Capital (personal financial sgetnrhe)
- ...
