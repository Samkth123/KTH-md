### Funding for Startups

3 things that need to be balanced in triangle:
- resources
- time (deadline)
- quality 


When started business you have cash situation

- Need to have a cash flow forecast (both for your control and funding)
	- This is a key to funding, given that you have a good business

Erik Skoglund när köpte företag hade rolling schedule av cash flow varje vecka för att se hur saker går.

Can do lots of things with bookkeping and profits and such, but cash is cash, and if cash is increasing you are alright but if decreasing not good.

##### Reason for funding
Cash flow challenges
- organization (if recruit sales person costs money before is productive)
- inventory
- marketing

Capital investments
- buying real estate 
- building facilities
- purchasing equpoment

Product development
- lif science
- high test

Three types of financing sources

- bootstrapping
	- owner
	- family,friends
	- customers, suppliers (can ask custaomers to pay early, ==JAG GÖR + tar inte ut salary==)
	- subsidies
- Equity financing
	- private equity (business angels, ventuer capital, buy out capital)
	- Public equity (IPO)
- Debt financing
	- commercial loans and credits
	- governmental debt
- Other
	- crowdfunding
	- incubators


Shares vs own work (your time is worth something, ==berötta om delningen med krille==)
- concept is worth 600 k sek
- i work iwthout salry could earn 35k per month which is 20k per month after tax. 18 months 20 k = 360k
- offer: familt/Friends 20% of compant for 240 k sek
- shares
	- entreprenur 960k (80%)
	- familyfienrsd 240k 20%
	- 1200k total


Ibbe Gnem method
- work for salary
- save 50% of disposable income
- After 6 months you can work on startup for 6 months without salary
- After 12 months you ahve 12 months to go



Catch 22 
- impossible situation basically
- banks will lend you umbrella when its sunny outside, but want it back when its rainy

Five C's when borrowing money
- Capacity (company, personla, ability to pay back loan)
- Capital (personal financial sgetnrhe)
- ...



evergreen fund goes on forever, closed end fund stops after a while

syndication - co investment
- people invest together and diversify risk
- not only me who is stupid but other people as well


Business model of PE firms

distribution waterfall
- prefered return: a minimum rate of return ex 8% which must be achieved before ant carried interest
- carried inteerst share of profitcs above preffered return ex 20%
management fees


How do i find
- business angels
	- No directory or website
	- Go via different incubators
	- Eric could direct to couple of people
	- Get lots of requests - have dealflow that is disturbing to them - difficult to get their interest - best to find someone who has relation with them
	- would like to have business angels who are into your area and worked in it before
- venture capital companies
	- sweden venture capital association
	- Here everyone who is into PE is a member
	- Also get many requests


The pecking order theory
- entrepreneurs prefer to use internal funding over debt funding

the theory of asymmetric informtaion
- you know more about your company than investors do, but they know more about general market than you do - so never equal distribution of information between you

What to include in VC pitching
- 5 key questions (basically business plan)
	- Who sells
	- what
	- to whom
	- why
	- and at what price?
- What more?

Bring a 1 or 2 pager to VC as well


Royalty financing
- we believe in you and get money back by getting royalty from what you are selling
- it can exceed what you borrow but they do take risk


**What i valued when?**
early (transaction multiples ex 5xEBITDA) - expansion (market multiples) - mature (discounted cash flow)
management -> business idea -> industry specific -> revenues -> cash flows
