### Legal issues

When creating a business, when need board of directors?
When small company - create advisory board, you get good things out of getting competence in company but is also easier to do as its a group of qualified members to support the business. They will also be more open to accepting advisor position rather than accept being a director (mainly because of the responsibility).
- jobbigt att vara med i board of directors, men enklare att vara advisor board

after prototype, there is not only you and team who believe in the product, you also have reference customers who believe in the product. This then leads to multiple buying customers. Biggest value when have positive cash flow which shows that you bring in more moeny than you spend.

More value driver
- independent of owner (==Berätta i rapporten att mitt bolag har detta problem jag orkar inte konsulta längre men då får jag låta de dö ner pga man själv är hela bolaget==)
- Competition among buyers (==HPE, juniper networks, aruba, osv...==)
-  Timing
- Growth potential/scalable
- Fit with industry structure
- Orders
- Qualified majority among owners


Buyers perspective
- Different view in opportunity
- valuation is psychology - why are you sellung or buying
- buyers keep synergies to themselves
- Sophisticated sellers want to know about your plans and negotiate synergy premium for themselves

Sell company or operations
- sell company you sell all shares
- operations then you sell part of the company?
	- ex intel selling chips and designing chips
	- if sell company and shares that person takes over all responsibility so if company is being sued new owner takes on that. Tex ABB on combustionengines company 
	- If you are industrial buyer you want to buy the operations not the company, because you do not want the liability and such, but if you are selling then you want someone to take it all.
- Can also sell contracts to deliver and such



Bankruptcy 
- Can happen to profitable company too
- If you have so many bills to pay you can go into bankruptcy
