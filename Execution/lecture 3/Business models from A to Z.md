Business models from A - Z 
A business model (also called a business design) is the mechanism by which a business intends to generate revenue and profits. It is a summary of how a company plans to serve its customers. It involves both strategy and implementation. It is the totality of: 
- How it will select its customers
- How it defines and differentiates its product offerings
- How it creates utility for its customers
- How it acquires and keeps customers
- How it goes to the market (promotion strategy and distribution strategy)
- How it defines the tasks to be performed
- How it configures its resources
- How it captures profit

###### Bait and hook strategy
Over the years, business models have become much more sophisticated. The **bait and hook business model** (also referred to as the **razor and blades business model** or the tied products model) was introduced in the early 20th century. This involves offering a **basic product** at a very **low cost**, often at a loss (**the "bait"**), then charging excessive amounts for refills or associated products or services (**the "hook"**). Examples include: razor (bait) and blades (hook); cell phones (bait) and air time (hook); computer printers (bait) and ink cartridge refills (hook); and cameras (bait) and prints (hook). An interesting variant of this model is a software developer that gives away its word processor reader for free but charges several hundred dollars for its word processor writer.

The razor and blades business model (also called the "bait and hook model" or the "tied products model") works by selling a "master" product at a subsidised price, and making the profit on high margin "consumables" that are essential to the use of the master product. The master product may actually be sold at a loss, in order to "capture" the customer into using the consumable product.

Companies must change their business models as value migrates from industry to industry. **Ultimately the success or failure of a company depends first on how well its business design matches their customers' priorities**
