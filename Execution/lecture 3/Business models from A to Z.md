Business models from A - Z 
A business model (also called a business design) is the mechanism by which a business intends to generate revenue and profits. It is a summary of how a company plans to serve its customers. It involves both strategy and implementation. It is the totality of: 
- How it will select its customers
- How it defines and differentiates its product offerings
- How it creates utility for its customers
- How it acquires and keeps customers
- How it goes to the market (promotion strategy and distribution strategy)
- How it defines the tasks to be performed
- How it configures its resources
- How it captures profit

### Different business models
#### Bait and hook strategy
Over the years, business models have become much more sophisticated. The **bait and hook business model** (also referred to as the **razor and blades business model** or the tied products model) was introduced in the early 20th century. This involves offering a **basic product** at a very **low cost**, often at a loss (**the "bait"**), then charging excessive amounts for refills or associated products or services (**the "hook"**). Examples include: razor (bait) and blades (hook); cell phones (bait) and air time (hook); computer printers (bait) and ink cartridge refills (hook); and cameras (bait) and prints (hook). An interesting variant of this model is a software developer that gives away its word processor reader for free but charges several hundred dollars for its word processor writer.

The razor and blades business model (also called the "bait and hook model" or the "tied products model") works by selling a "master" product at a subsidised price, and making the profit on high margin "consumables" that are essential to the use of the master product. The master product may actually be sold at a loss, in order to "capture" the customer into using the consumable product.

Companies must change their business models as value migrates from industry to industry. **Ultimately the success or failure of a company depends first on how well its business design matches their customers' priorities**

#### Network effect business models 
Network effects were used as justification for some of the business models for dot-coms in the late 1990s. These firms operated under the belief that when a new market comes into being which contains strong network effects, firms should care more about growing their market share than about becoming profitable. This was believed because market share will determine which firm can set technical and marketing standards and thus determine the basis of future competition.

A good example of this strategy was that deployed by Mirabilis, the Israeli start-up which pioneered instant messaging ("IM") and was bought by America Online. By giving away their ICQ product for free and preventing interoperability between their client software and other products, they were able to corner the market for instant messaging. Because of the network effect, new IM users gained much more value by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and join its large network of users) than they would using a competing system. As was typical for that era, the company never made any attempt to generate profits from their dominant position before selling out.

Network effects become significant after a certain subscription percentage has been achieved, called **==critical mass==**. At the critical mass point, the value obtained from the good or service is greater than or equal to the price paid for the good or service. As the value of the good is determined by the user base, this implies that after a certain number of people have subscribed to the service or purchased the good, additional people will subscribe to the service or purchase the good due to the positive utility:price ratio. Until this point has been achieved, however, only early adopters will subscribe.

**Network effects are commonly mistaken for economies of scale**, which result from business size rather than interoperability (see also natural monopoly). To help clarify the distinction people speak of demand side vs. supply side economies of scale. Classical economies of scale are on the production side, while network effects arise on the demand side. Network effects are also mistaken for economies of scope.

There are very strong network effects operating in the market for widely-used computer software. Take for example Microsoft Office. For many people choosing an office suite, prime considerations include how valuable having learned that office suite will prove to potential employers, and how well the software interoperates with other users. That is, since learning to use an office suite takes many hours, they want to invest that time learning the office suite that will make them most attractive to potential employers (or consulting clients, etc), and they also want to be able to share documents
