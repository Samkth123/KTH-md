### Framing intentions

Do you ever feel you are working through an endless to-do list, often losing sight of the destination and why it matters? Or that you are responding on autopilot, going through the motions, but perhaps missing opportunities to learn, grow, and adapt? You’re not alone.

Surprisingly, the most adaptable people are not those who set the most intentions but those who frame their intentions in the right way

#### Focus on the journey

Prioritize the learning experience itself by framing your desired outcome as a learning intention rather than a performance goal. Research shows that this can help people persist and expand their learning more than if they started with a performance goal. 

Right approach: "I want to learn how to play softball" 
Wrong approach: "I want to win the softball league trophy" 


#### Link to meaning

Connect your learning experience to something personally meaningful. Research shows that personal meaning can give people a feeling of self-direction, increasing their enjoyment, interest, and excitement during learning. 

Right approach: "If I learn how to fix a car, I can help my friends and family if they ever run into trouble" 
Wrong approach: "I don't get why I need to learn how to fix a car. I'll just take it to the repair shop when it needs fixing" 




It is easy to get into the trap of setting performance goals when you should be setting learning intentions. So what exactly is the difference? The distinction can feel subtle, but significant impact comes from knowing when to apply each.

- **Performance goals** are what they sound like—goals to hit certain numbers or achieve a particular target. They are helpful when there is something specific you want to achieve and you have already learned the skills or knowledge needed to achieve it.
- **Learning intentions**, on the other hand, are most useful when it’s time to build new skills and knowledge, especially when you are adapting to changes that challenge you to do things differently.

Neuroscience confirms that exploration and curiosity feel great—so setting and working on a learning intention should be fun! Focusing on a performance goal too early can short-circuit your learning and slow you down, taking attention and energy away from the learning that will enable you to perform in the long term.

Psychology studies show that when participants are given something new to learn, focusing on the journey rather than the outcome appears to improve both enjoyment and attention, two things associated with high-quality learning. If you find yourself framing learning as a burdensome investment that pays off later, try to flip your thinking and focus on enjoying the learning itself, right now.

### Mindset

- In a landmark experiment, 80-year-old men primed to be in “the mindset of a 50-year-old” took an eyesight test and outperformed 80-year-old men who were primed to remember that they were 80 years old. 
- A US-based experiment showed that a training on growth mindset was more likely to improve the grade point average (GPA) of high school students than a general training about the brain.  
- The following feelings improve when an individual adopts resilient mindsets (such as growth, beginner, or creative mindsets): 
    - Job performance 
    - Academic achievement
    - Well being 
    - Sense of fulfillment

#### APR
Awareness  Pause Reframe

Be aware of your mindset, then understand how to change it then change it

##### Practicing APR

The beauty of APR is that it can be utilized at any time to shift your mindset in subtle or bold ways. Let’s take two minutes to practice it right now.  

- **Awareness**: Think of something you have been finding challenging. What does it make you think and feel? What are your mindsets?
- **Pause**: Take a pause in this very moment to center yourself. Maybe take a few deep breaths or plant your feet on the floor.
- **Reframe**: What opportunities would there be if you were to shift your mindset?

**Questions to reframe from fixed to growth**

- How can this challenge be an opportunity?
- What could be possible if I learn and develop from this experience?

**Questions to reframe from expert to curious**

- What questions, new perspectives, or opportunities do I want to explore?
- If I approach this with fresh eyes, forgetting for now what I already know, what would I get curious about?
- What would be possible if I could embrace the struggles that come with learning something new?

**Questions to reframe from victim to agent**

- What are the various ways I can influence the situation?
- What do I already have going for me? What capabilities, ideas, or resources could I access to successfully navigate this challenge?


**Questions to reframe from certainty to exploration**

- What is the smallest thing I can do to try out a different approach and learn fast?
- What are three other perspectives on potential solutions to this problem?


###### How to help others get same mindset:
**Prime them**  
Using phrases is a great way to prime others. For example, to get others into an abundance mindset you might ask, “What is the win-win here?” For a growth mindset you could try, “What can we learn from this?”
