### Framing intentions

Do you ever feel you are working through an endless to-do list, often losing sight of the destination and why it matters? Or that you are responding on autopilot, going through the motions, but perhaps missing opportunities to learn, grow, and adapt? You’re not alone.

Surprisingly, the most adaptable people are not those who set the most intentions but those who frame their intentions in the right way

#### Focus on the journey

Prioritize the learning experience itself by framing your desired outcome as a learning intention rather than a performance goal. Research shows that this can help people persist and expand their learning more than if they started with a performance goal. 

Right approach: "I want to learn how to play softball" 
Wrong approach: "I want to win the softball league trophy" 


#### Link to meaning

Connect your learning experience to something personally meaningful. Research shows that personal meaning can give people a feeling of self-direction, increasing their enjoyment, interest, and excitement during learning. 

Right approach: "If I learn how to fix a car, I can help my friends and family if they ever run into trouble" 
Wrong approach: "I don't get why I need to learn how to fix a car. I'll just take it to the repair shop when it needs fixing" 




It is easy to get into the trap of setting performance goals when you should be setting learning intentions. So what exactly is the difference? The distinction can feel subtle, but significant impact comes from knowing when to apply each.

- **Performance goals** are what they sound like—goals to hit certain numbers or achieve a particular target. They are helpful when there is something specific you want to achieve and you have already learned the skills or knowledge needed to achieve it.
- **Learning intentions**, on the other hand, are most useful when it’s time to build new skills and knowledge, especially when you are adapting to changes that challenge you to do things differently.

Neuroscience confirms that exploration and curiosity feel great—so setting and working on a learning intention should be fun! Focusing on a performance goal too early can short-circuit your learning and slow you down, taking attention and energy away from the learning that will enable you to perform in the long term.

Psychology studies show that when participants are given something new to learn, focusing on the journey rather than the outcome appears to improve both enjoyment and attention, two things associated with high-quality learning. If you find yourself framing learning as a burdensome investment that pays off later, try to flip your thinking and focus on enjoying the learning itself, right now.

### Mindset

- In a landmark experiment, 80-year-old men primed to be in “the mindset of a 50-year-old” took an eyesight test and outperformed 80-year-old men who were primed to remember that they were 80 years old. 
- A US-based experiment showed that a training on growth mindset was more likely to improve the grade point average (GPA) of high school students than a general training about the brain.  
- The following feelings improve when an individual adopts resilient mindsets (such as growth, beginner, or creative mindsets): 
    - Job performance 
    - Academic achievement
    - Well being 
    - Sense of fulfillment
