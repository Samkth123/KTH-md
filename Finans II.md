Debt instruments:
### Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

Treasury bills are short-term government securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (and similar institutions in other countries). They are considered some of the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. T-bills do not pay interest in the traditional sense but are sold at a discount. Investors buy these bills at a price lower than their face (par) value and receive the face value upon maturity; the difference between the purchase price and the face value is the investor's return.

### Key Features:

- **Maturity**: Typically, T-bills have maturities of one year or less (commonly 1 month, 3 months, or 6 months).
- **Risk**: Regarded as virtually risk-free, hence often used as the benchmark for the risk-free rate in financial models.

### Commercial Paper

Commercial paper is an unsecured form of promissory note that pays a fixed rate of interest. It is issued by large corporations to finance their short-term cash needs, such as payroll, accounts payable, and inventories. It is typically used for the short-term funding needs of the issuing company.

### Key Features:

- **Maturity**: Commercial paper usually matures within a very short period, ranging from a few days to up to 270 days.
- **Risk**: As it is unsecured (not backed by collateral), the risk is higher than government securities. The interest rate is slightly higher than that of T-bills, reflecting the increased risk.

### Repurchase Agreements (Repos)

A repurchase agreement, or repo, is a short-term agreement to sell securities in order to buy them back at a higher price at a future date. The initial sale of the asset (typically government securities) is combined with an agreement to repurchase the same asset at a future date for a price that reflects the interest payment.

Key features of RePo–“I promise to repurchase these securities tomorrow at a slightly higher price”

### Key Features:

- **Use**: Repos are used by businesses (such as banks and dealers in money markets) for short-term funding. They are also used by central banks to control the money supply.
- **Structure**: The party selling the security agrees to repurchase it on a specified date and at a predetermined price, reflecting the interest on the loan.
- **Security**: Although the transaction is structured as a sale and repurchase, it is essentially a collateralized short-term loan, where the securities sold are used as collateral, which reduces the credit risk.


The bond market - fixed income

1. **Fixed Income**: Bonds are typically categorized as fixed-income securities because they provide periodic income payments at fixed interest rates.
    
2. **T-bonds (Treasury Bonds)**: Long-term government securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. They have longer maturities, typically between 10 and 30 years, and offer periodic interest payments. Treasury bills are short term tho.
    
3. **Municipal Bonds**: Issued by states, cities, or other local government entities. Interest income is often exempt from federal taxes and sometimes from state and local taxes.
    
4. **MBS (Mortgage-Backed Securities) and ABS (Asset-Backed Securities)**: These are securities backed by mortgage loans (MBS) or other types of assets (ABS), like auto loans or credit card debt. They provide income streams from the underlying assets.
    
5. **Corporate Bonds**: Issued by corporations to fund operations, growth, or acquisitions. They are riskier than government bonds and thus pay higher interest rates.
    
6. **Credit Ratings**: Bonds are rated by credit rating agencies. Investment-grade bonds (rated AAA to BBB) are considered safer with lower yields, while bonds rated below BBB are known as high-yield or junk bonds, offering higher returns but with increased risk.
    
7. **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading**: Most bonds, unlike stocks, are traded over-the-counter, which means transactions occur directly between parties without the centralization of an exchange.

key differences and features of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, which are critical components of the government debt market:

1. **Maturity Differences**:
    
    - **Treasury Notes**: These have shorter maturities ranging up to 10 years.
    - **Treasury Bonds**: These have longer maturities, from 10 years up to 30 years.
2. **Common Features**:
    
    - Both types of securities have a par value of $1,000 and pay interest semiannually.
3. **Liquidity and Safety**:
    
    - Treasury securities are among the most liquid financial instruments, meaning they can be easily bought and sold without significantly affecting their price.
    - They are also considered to be the most secure investments, often referred to as a "flight to safety" asset. During times of economic uncertainty or crisis, investors tend to buy these government securities because of their low risk of default.


Mortgage-backed securities are pass-through securitiesbecause the cash flows produced by homeowners paying off their mortgages are passed through to investors


### What is a Mutual Fund?

A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. This allows individual investors access to a broad array of investments that would be difficult to manage on their own.

### Key Facts About Mutual Funds:

1. **Trading**: Shares are traded only once per day after the market closes, based on the fund's net asset value (NAV).
    
2. **Taxation**: The fund itself isn't taxed, but investors pay taxes on capital gains from selling shares and on income from fund distributions.
    
3. **Important Metrics**:
    
    - **Assets Under Management (AUM)**: Indicates the size of the fund.
    - **Total Expense Ratio (TER)**: Shows the percentage of the fund's assets used for operational expenses.
    - **Turnover Ratio**: Measures how frequently the fund buys and sells assets, indicating the activity level of the fund manager.


- **Implication**: A high NAV suggests that the value of the fund's assets has increased. This could be due to positive market movements, successful investment strategies, or other factors that have appreciated the asset values within the fund.
- **Investor Perspective**: For current investors, a decrease in NAV can be concerning as it reflects a loss in value. For new investors, a lower NAV might be seen as a more affordable entry point into the fund, assuming they believe the fund's performance will improve.
