### Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

Treasury bills are short-term government securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (and similar institutions in other countries). They are considered some of the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. T-bills do not pay interest in the traditional sense but are sold at a discount. Investors buy these bills at a price lower than their face (par) value and receive the face value upon maturity; the difference between the purchase price and the face value is the investor's return.

### Key Features:

- **Maturity**: Typically, T-bills have maturities of one year or less (commonly 1 month, 3 months, or 6 months).
- **Risk**: Regarded as virtually risk-free, hence often used as the benchmark for the risk-free rate in financial models.

### Commercial Paper

Commercial paper is an unsecured form of promissory note that pays a fixed rate of interest. It is issued by large corporations to finance their short-term cash needs, such as payroll, accounts payable, and inventories. It is typically used for the short-term funding needs of the issuing company.

### Key Features:

- **Maturity**: Commercial paper usually matures within a very short period, ranging from a few days to up to 270 days.
- **Risk**: As it is unsecured (not backed by collateral), the risk is higher than government securities. The interest rate is slightly higher than that of T-bills, reflecting the increased risk.

### Repurchase Agreements (Repos)

A repurchase agreement, or repo, is a short-term agreement to sell securities in order to buy them back at a higher price at a future date. The initial sale of the asset (typically government securities) is combined with an agreement to repurchase the same asset at a future date for a price that reflects the interest payment.

Key features of RePo–“I promise to repurchase these securities tomorrow at a slightly higher price”

### Key Features:

- **Use**: Repos are used by businesses (such as banks and dealers in money markets) for short-term funding. They are also used by central banks to control the money supply.
- **Structure**: The party selling the security agrees to repurchase it on a specified date and at a predetermined price, reflecting the interest on the loan.
- **Security**: Although the transaction is structured as a sale and repurchase, it is essentially a collateralized short-term loan, where the securities sold are used as collateral, which reduces the credit risk.
