Debt instruments:
### Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

Treasury bills are short-term government securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (and similar institutions in other countries). They are considered some of the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. T-bills do not pay interest in the traditional sense but are sold at a discount. Investors buy these bills at a price lower than their face (par) value and receive the face value upon maturity; the difference between the purchase price and the face value is the investor's return.

### Key Features:

- **Maturity**: Typically, T-bills have maturities of one year or less (commonly 1 month, 3 months, or 6 months).
- **Risk**: Regarded as virtually risk-free, hence often used as the benchmark for the risk-free rate in financial models.

### Commercial Paper

Commercial paper is an unsecured form of promissory note that pays a fixed rate of interest. It is issued by large corporations to finance their short-term cash needs, such as payroll, accounts payable, and inventories. It is typically used for the short-term funding needs of the issuing company.

### Key Features:

- **Maturity**: Commercial paper usually matures within a very short period, ranging from a few days to up to 270 days.
- **Risk**: As it is unsecured (not backed by collateral), the risk is higher than government securities. The interest rate is slightly higher than that of T-bills, reflecting the increased risk.

### Repurchase Agreements (Repos)

A repurchase agreement, or repo, is a short-term agreement to sell securities in order to buy them back at a higher price at a future date. The initial sale of the asset (typically government securities) is combined with an agreement to repurchase the same asset at a future date for a price that reflects the interest payment.

Key features of RePo–“I promise to repurchase these securities tomorrow at a slightly higher price”

### Key Features:

- **Use**: Repos are used by businesses (such as banks and dealers in money markets) for short-term funding. They are also used by central banks to control the money supply.
- **Structure**: The party selling the security agrees to repurchase it on a specified date and at a predetermined price, reflecting the interest on the loan.
- **Security**: Although the transaction is structured as a sale and repurchase, it is essentially a collateralized short-term loan, where the securities sold are used as collateral, which reduces the credit risk.


The bond market - fixed income

1. **Fixed Income**: Bonds are typically categorized as fixed-income securities because they provide periodic income payments at fixed interest rates.
    
2. **T-bonds (Treasury Bonds)**: Long-term government securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. They have longer maturities, typically between 10 and 30 years, and offer periodic interest payments. Treasury bills are short term tho.
    
3. **Municipal Bonds**: Issued by states, cities, or other local government entities. Interest income is often exempt from federal taxes and sometimes from state and local taxes.
    
4. **MBS (Mortgage-Backed Securities) and ABS (Asset-Backed Securities)**: These are securities backed by mortgage loans (MBS) or other types of assets (ABS), like auto loans or credit card debt. They provide income streams from the underlying assets.
    
5. **Corporate Bonds**: Issued by corporations to fund operations, growth, or acquisitions. They are riskier than government bonds and thus pay higher interest rates.
    
6. **Credit Ratings**: Bonds are rated by credit rating agencies. Investment-grade bonds (rated AAA to BBB) are considered safer with lower yields, while bonds rated below BBB are known as high-yield or junk bonds, offering higher returns but with increased risk.
    
7. **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading**: Most bonds, unlike stocks, are traded over-the-counter, which means transactions occur directly between parties without the centralization of an exchange.


What is a bond?
–When buying a bond, the investor pays a certain amount of money to the issuer (a firm, a government...).
–In return, the issuerpromisestopayregularinterest(coupons) as wellas a lump sumat the end (face value)


key differences and features of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, which are critical components of the government debt market:

1. **Maturity Differences**:
    
    - **Treasury Notes**: These have shorter maturities ranging up to 10 years.
    - **Treasury Bonds**: These have longer maturities, from 10 years up to 30 years.
2. **Common Features**:
    
    - Both types of securities have a par value of $1,000 and pay interest semiannually.
3. **Liquidity and Safety**:
    
    - Treasury securities are among the most liquid financial instruments, meaning they can be easily bought and sold without significantly affecting their price.
    - They are also considered to be the most secure investments, often referred to as a "flight to safety" asset. During times of economic uncertainty or crisis, investors tend to buy these government securities because of their low risk of default.


Mortgage-backed securities are pass-through securitiesbecause the cash flows produced by homeowners paying off their mortgages are passed through to investors


### What is a Mutual Fund?

A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. This allows individual investors access to a broad array of investments that would be difficult to manage on their own.

### Key Facts About Mutual Funds:

1. **Trading**: Shares are traded only once per day after the market closes, based on the fund's net asset value (NAV).
    
2. **Taxation**: The fund itself isn't taxed, but investors pay taxes on capital gains from selling shares and on income from fund distributions.
    
3. **Important Metrics**:
    
    - **Assets Under Management (AUM)**: Indicates the size of the fund.
    - **Total Expense Ratio (TER)**: Shows the percentage of the fund's assets used for operational expenses.
    - **Turnover Ratio**: Measures how frequently the fund buys and sells assets, indicating the activity level of the fund manager.


- **Implication**: A high NAV suggests that the value of the fund's assets has increased. This could be due to positive market movements, successful investment strategies, or other factors that have appreciated the asset values within the fund.
- **Investor Perspective**: For current investors, a decrease in NAV can be concerning as it reflects a loss in value. For new investors, a lower NAV might be seen as a more affordable entry point into the fund, assuming they believe the fund's performance will improve.



To evaluate if the returns on a risky investment are worthwhile, you can use the Sharpe ratio, which measures excess return per unit of risk


Utility from an investment●The purposeofanyeconomicactivityis tomaximizeutility!●First, we need a utility function!●A reasonable utility function should:–increase with the returnof the investment–decrease with the risk–decrease with risk aversion

Determining the optimal allocation:
●Graphically, the solution is where the indifference curve touches the CAL.


Two-fund separation
●According to the separation property, you can solve the portfolio choice problem in two separate steps:
1.Determine the optimal risky portfolio (P) and draw the Capital Allocation Line (CAL).
2.Position your complete portfolio on the CALby combining Pwith the risk-free asset, so that you reach the highest indifference curve.
●Both steps depend on mean-variance utility¨¨¨¨¨

Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
●Maurice Kendall (1953) found no predictable pattern in stock price changes.
●EMH says stock prices already reflect all available information
●A forecast about favorable futureperformance leads to favorable currentperformance, as market participants rush to trade on new information.
–Result: Prices change until expected returns are exactly commensurate with risk.
●New information is unpredictable; if it could be predicted, then the prediction would be part of today’s information.
●Stock price changes follow a random walk.

The term "Behavioral Bias – Here and Now" refers to the concept in behavioral finance where individuals make decisions based on the information immediately available to them, often ignoring the bigger picture or long-term consequences. The acronym WYSIATI, which stands for "What You See Is All There Is," encapsulates a common cognitive bias where people tend to focus on the information they have at hand while neglecting information that is not immediately visible. This can lead to a range of investment behaviors that might not align with rational financial decision-making:

- **Mental Accounting**: Treating money differently depending on its source or intended use, rather than considering all personal funds as interchangeable.
    
- **Herding Mentality**: Following the crowd into popular investments without thorough analysis, assuming the majority knows best.
    
- **Abstract vs Tangible**: Favoring investments that are more tangible or understandable over those that are abstract, even if the latter are potentially more profitable.
    
- **Present vs Future**: Overvaluing immediate rewards at the expense of future benefits, often leading to underinvestment in long-term goals.

Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value of an underlying asset or group of assets—the "derivatives" of prices from other securities. Here's a brief overview:

### Types of Derivatives:

1. **Options**: Give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price within a specific time period.
2. **Futures and Forward Contracts**: Obligate the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, an asset at a set price at a future date. Futures are standardized and traded on exchanges, while forwards are private agreements between parties.
3. **Swaps**: Contracts to exchange cash flows or other financial instruments, often used to exchange one type of cash flow for another (e.g., fixed to floating interest rate).



**Forward Contract vs. Futures Contract**

**Forward Contract:**

- **Customization**: Tailored to the specific needs of the two parties involved.
- **Settlement**: Occurs at maturity of the contract; no daily settlement.
- **Counterparty Risk**: Exists until the contract matures because it's a private agreement.
- **Liquidity**: Generally illiquid due to the custom nature of the agreement.
- **Early Termination**: Difficult to cancel or modify before maturity.

**Futures Contract:**

- **Standardization**: Features standardized specifications for commodity, quantity, quality, and settlement dates.
- **Daily Settlement**: Profits and losses are tallied daily, with the margin account adjusted accordingly (marked to market).
- **Marked to Market**: Each day's ending price is used to determine gains and losses.
- **Liquidity**: Highly liquid as they are traded on an exchange.
- **Flexibility**: Can be easily sold or rolled over before maturity.


**Open Interest and Reversing Trades**

**Open Interest:**

- **Definition**: Open interest refers to the total number of derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that are not settled and remain open.
- **Significance**: It's a measure often used to gauge the liquidity or activity level of a particular contract or market.

**Reversing Trades:**

- **Closing Positions**: If you hold a long position and wish to close it, you can take an equal and opposite short position, which effectively cancels out the original position.
- **Usage**: Most futures contracts are closed out prior to expiration through this method of reversing trades.
- **Actual Delivery**: A very small percentage of futures contracts (typically 1-3%) lead to physical delivery of the underlying asset. Most participants use futures for hedging or speculative purposes rather than to exchange physical commodities


**Margin and Trading Arrangements**

**Initial Margin:**

- **Definition**: The initial margin is the upfront payment made when entering into a futures contract. It's a percentage of the contract value and can be in cash or securities.
- **Purpose**: It acts as a guarantee of the trader's ability to fulfill the contract.

**Maintenance Margin:**

- **Definition**: This is the minimum amount of equity that must be maintained in the margin account at all times.
- **Function**: If the account balance falls below this level due to market movements, it triggers the need for additional funds to restore the initial margin level.

**Margin Call:**

- **Trigger**: When the account's balance drops to the maintenance margin level, the broker issues a margin call.
- **Response Required**: The trader must deposit additional funds into the margin account to bring it back up to the initial margin requirement. If this is not done, the broker may close out the position to limit potential losses.

**American vs European Options**

**American Style Options:**

- **Exercise**: Can be exercised at any point up to and including the expiration date.
- **Premium**: Generally higher because of the added flexibility of early exercise.
- **Naming Convention**: Often written with capital letters (Call or Put).
- **Trading Venue**: Mostly traded on formal exchanges.

**European Style Options:**

- **Exercise**: Can only be exercised precisely on the expiration date, not before.
- **Premium**: Typically lower due to the restriction on the exercise period.
- **Naming Convention**: Often written in lowercase (call or put).
- **Trading Venue**: Commonly found in Over The Counter (OTC) markets, which are less standardized.


**Covered Call Strategy**

The covered call is a popular options trading strategy that involves two main actions by the investor:

1. **Owning the Underlying Stock**: The investor first needs to own the underlying stock.
2. **Writing (Selling) Call Options**: The investor then writes call options for the same stock. This means they sell the right to another investor to buy their stock at a predetermined price (the strike price, X) before the option expires.

### Key Points of a Covered Call:

- **Giving Up Potential Gains**: By writing a call, the seller gives up any potential stock gains above the strike price (X) in exchange for receiving the option premium upfront. This premium is kept regardless of how the stock performs.
    
- **Motivation**: There are several reasons why an investor might choose to implement a covered call:
    
    - **Extra Income**: The immediate motivation is to earn additional income from the option premium, which can provide a small buffer against a decline in the stock price.
    - **Sell Discipline**: If the investor was planning to sell the stock at a certain price level, writing a call at that strike price can help enforce this discipline—essentially setting a predetermined sell price.
    - **Expectations of Market Conditions**: This strategy is particularly appealing if the investor believes that the stock price will not increase significantly before the option expires. It's less beneficial in a rapidly rising market because the investor would miss out on gains above the strike price.
- **Downside Risk**: It’s important to note that while the premium provides some cushion, it does not eliminate the downside risk of holding the stock. If the stock price falls significantly, the losses could outweigh the income from the premium.
    

### Considerations:

- **Risk vs. Reward**: The covered call limits the upside potential in return for immediate income. Investors need to balance their need for potential capital gains against the desire for current income.
- **Market Outlook**: This strategy is best suited for a neutral to slightly bullish outlook on the underlying stock, as significant upward movements in the stock price could lead to missed opportunities.

By using this strategy, investors can generate income from their stock holdings while potentially setting a target exit price for their shares. However, like all investment strategies, it comes with its own set of risks and rewards that need to be carefully considered.


Straddle
●The buyer of a straddle (long straddle) is betting the stock price will change much (in either direction)
●Buy call and put with same exercise price and maturity
●The straddle is a bet on volatility.
–To make a profit, the change in stock price must be large enough to cover the cost of both options.
–You need a strong change in stock price in either direction.
●The writer of a straddle (short straddle) is betting the stock price will not change much.


Spreads
●A spread is a combination of two or more calls (or two or more puts) on the same stock with either different exercise price or different times to maturity.
●Some options are bought, whereas others are sold
●A bullish spread is a way to profit from stock price increases.
●Motivation
–Trade off extreme profits to cut cost
